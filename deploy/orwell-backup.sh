# orwell-backup.sh (B72/ops A8) — back up EVERYTHING a game owns, correctly.
#
# The state lives in TWO places (the layout the old prose misstated):
#   <app>/data/            engine config (.env incl. the generated token) + saves/ (per-user games)
#   <app>/frontend/data/   the front-end SQLite (accounts, chats, settings) + uploads
#
# Usage:  orwell-backup.sh [dest-dir]      (default: <app>/backups)
# Output: orwell-backup-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.tar.gz — restore with orwell-restore.sh.
#
# Scheduling (DEPLOY-9, 2026-07-05 ops-hygiene close-out): this script was manual-only, with no
# retention policy — `backups/` grew unbounded on the same disk the game's saves/portraits/models
# also occupy. `deploy/systemd/orwell-backup.timer` now runs this daily; retention is enforced HERE
# (not just by the timer) so a manually-triggered run (control panel / cron / CI) prunes too.
# ORWELL_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=0 disables pruning (keep every backup forever).
