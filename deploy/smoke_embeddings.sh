# deploy/smoke_embeddings.sh — the embeddings warm-up integrity guard for the deploy smoke.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (a real prod-breaker, 2026-06-27 → 2026-07-14, issues #1590/#1600).
# fastembed's ESM build does `import tar from "tar"`. A package.json security bump forced
# `tar@7` (pure-ESM, NO default export), so that import threw at MODULE-EVALUATION time —
# BEFORE any network fetch — with:
#     The requested module 'tar' does not provide an export named 'default'
# The engine's boot warm-up caught it and fell back to `DeterministicEmbedding` (a DESIGNED,
# graceful fallback). So every production boot ran semantic recall permanently DEGRADED, and
# NO gate saw it: the smoke booted the engine but never asserted the embedding provider warmed
# up. This file closes that gap.
#
# THE TWO CASES THIS GUARD MUST SEPARATE (getting this wrong makes the gate useless):
#   • INTENTIONAL fallback — `ORWELL_EMBEDDINGS` unset ⇒ the deterministic provider is the
#     DESIGNED default. `degraded:false`, `provider:"deterministic"`. This is NOT a failure and
#     MUST pass.
#   • REAL failure — `ORWELL_EMBEDDINGS=fastembed` requested, but warm-up CRASHED on an
#     import/exception (the #1590 tar-import class). This MUST fail the smoke loudly, because it
#     will never self-heal: every boot degrades forever.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR. `node dist/embedWorker.js --prefetch` runs the EXACT import + model-extract
# path the engine warm-up runs (`await import("fastembed")` → `FlagEmbedding.init` → tar-extract
# the model). Its exit code + output classify cleanly, because the #1590 crash happens at IMPORT
# (before any socket) while a genuine model-download failure happens LATER, during the fetch:
#   • exit 0                       → ok           (import + extract + cache all worked)
#   • non-zero, network signature  → network-skip (model CDN unreachable in this sandbox — a
#                                                   BENIGN, offline-CI condition, NOT #1590)
#   • non-zero, anything else      → import-fail  (the #1590 class — FAIL, fail-safe default)
# The default for an UNRECOGNISED non-zero exit is `import-fail`, on purpose: a network-absent CI
# must NEVER silently pass a real import crash (the whole point of the guard).
