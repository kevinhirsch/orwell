# orwell-restore.sh (B72/ops A8) — restore a backup made by orwell-backup.sh.
#
# Stops the services, then ATOMICALLY REPLACES the engine + front-end data subtrees with the
# backup's, then restarts. "Atomically replace" — not "extract over" — is deliberate and
# load-bearing (data-safety audit 2026-07-13):
#
#   * P0 — engine saves are monotonic-versioned files (data/saves/<user>/vNNNNNN.json) and the
#     engine's loadLatest() returns the HIGHEST version. Extracting an OLDER backup ON TOP of a
#     newer live tree left the newer saves in place, so the restore SILENTLY DID NOT roll the game
#     back; multi-file components (portraits) were UNIONED, reintroducing stale-cast faces. So we
#     MOVE the live subtrees ASIDE first (never rm -rf — a timestamped .pre-restore-<ts> sibling is
#     kept for rollback) and only THEN extract, so what lands is exactly the backup, nothing merged.
#     On ANY extraction failure the moved-aside tree is moved back (fail-safe).
#
#   * P1 — a backup carries data/.env (ports, tokens, and the PUBLIC-EXPOSURE / TLS / GIT_TOKEN
#     profile: ORWELL_PUBLIC, ALLOWED_HOSTS/ORIGINS, SECURE_COOKIES, ORWELL_BIND_HOST, ORWELL_TLS_*)
#     but NOT the matching OS state (cloudflared/Caddy/cap-drop-in). Restoring an OLDER .env would
#     silently revert exposure/TLS/token while the OS services keep running → host-header/Origin
#     rejections, HTTPS cookie mismatch, broken auto-update. DECISION (the safe one): KEEP THE LIVE
#     data/.env — game state rolls back, host CONFIG does not. The backup's .env is preserved inside
#     the move-aside dir if ever needed. If there was no live .env at all, the backup's stands and we
#     print a loud note to re-run the public-deploy / HTTPS apply.
#
#   * Archive validation — refuse anything whose members are not exactly under data/ or
#     frontend/data/, so a stray `orwell restore /path/anything.tar.gz` can't drop arbitrary files
#     under the app tree.
#
# Usage: orwell-restore.sh <backup.tar.gz>
