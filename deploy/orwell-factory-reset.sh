# orwell — factory reset.
#
# "Factory reset" returns the app to first-run onboarding (OOBE) while PRESERVING the operator's
# LLM credentials — the API keys + the provider endpoint(s) — so you never have to re-enter your
# provider config. The SELECTED MODELS are RESET to the OOB defaults (issue #860; the ADR 0016
# two-tier pair): narrator z-ai/glm-5.2 + utility qwen/qwen3.6-flash on OpenRouter, portrait
# gemini-3.1-flash-image — a stale/placeholder
# pick can never ride across a reset. EVERYTHING ELSE is wiped: every per-user game sandbox (saves,
# souls, the hidden Vault layer) and the ENTIRE front-end store — all accounts, chats/sessions,
# memory, MCP configs, uploads, EVERY cast portrait / avatar / headshot, presets, and every other
# user setting. (The engine config data/.env is preserved, as in every reset.)
#
# This is intentionally IDENTICAL to the in-app admin "Factory Reset (OOBE)" button and to
# `orwell reset-oobe`: a reset must never throw away the operator's LLM credentials. The real
# work — preserve the model_endpoints (API keys), RESET the model selections to defaults, wipe the
# rest, rebuild — lives in orwell-oobe-reset.sh + frontend/scripts/oobe_reset.py. This script delegates to it so the two
# can NEVER drift. (Historically this script wiped the API keys too; that behavior was removed per
# the product decision that a factory reset keeps your LLM config — to also drop the keys, remove
# frontend/data/.app_key, .key, api_keys.json and app.db by hand.)
#
# Run on the Proxmox HOST or inside the container as root — same flags as the other resets:
#   bash /path/to/orwell-factory-reset.sh             # prompts to confirm (type RESET)
#   bash /path/to/orwell-factory-reset.sh --yes       # no prompt (automation)
#   bash /path/to/orwell-factory-reset.sh --dry-run   # show what WOULD be removed
#   bash /path/to/orwell-factory-reset.sh --no-restart # scrub but leave services down
#
# Paths/services are overridable via the same env vars orwell-oobe-reset.sh honors (APP_DIR,
# ORWELL_DATA_DIR, ORWELL_FE_DIR, ORWELL_FE_DATA_DIR, ORWELL_CONFIG_DIR, ORWELL_ENGINE_SVC, …).
