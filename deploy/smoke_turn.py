"""deploy/smoke_turn.py — one REAL turn through the deployed system (B71/ops A7).

Creates a game through the FRONT-END's guarded route (which must reach the token-enforcing
engine — the B67 contract, end-to-end), advances the live loop on the engine's authed player
channel until a player decision pends, and resolves it through the front-end's sanctioned
/api/orwell/decision route. Prints TURN OK on success; any gap (FE can't reach the engine,
the loop can't advance, the decision can't bind) fails loudly.
