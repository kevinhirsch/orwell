 * The VISIBLE elimination order of an ALREADY-RESOLVED competition (the 0006 staged-rounds

 * The staged endurance presentation narrows the field one houseguest at a time until the crowned
 * winner stands alone. This derives that drop order from the SAME `scores` `resolveCompetition`
 * already computed: the LOWEST score drops first, ascending up to (but excluding) the winner, who
 * survives every round by construction. It consumes NO randomness and reads NO new state — it is a
 * deterministic RE-TELLING of the one calibrated roll, so the staged presentation can NEVER perturb
 * the winner OR any downstream seeded roll. This is what makes the staged comp full-trajectory
 * outcome-neutral with the pre-staging single-shot model (the jury calibration band depends on it).
 *
 * `field` is the competitors' ids in their original (resolution) order; `result` is that roll's
 * output. The returned array lists every NON-winner, earliest drop first. Score ties break by the
 * original field order (stable), so the order is byte-stable for a given result.
