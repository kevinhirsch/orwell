/**
 * Typed error taxonomy for the engine's outward seams (audit E3/E7).
 *
 * The HTTP boundary used to classify "deliberate refusal" as `constructor === Error`, which made a
 * disk failure (Node fs errors are plain `Error`s) read as the CALLER's fault — a 400 that leaked
 * the data-dir path — and let a faulted integrity commit return 200 with a view of rolled-back
 * state. These classes give each failure mode its own identity:
 *
 * - `EngineRefusal` — a DELIBERATE engine refusal (illegal input, unavailable tool): the caller's
 *   fault, HTTP 400. Plain `Error` throws from older validation sites still classify the same way
 *   (back-compat); new refusal sites should prefer this class.
 * - `TurnRefusedError` — the fail-closed integrity checkpoint (0031) refused the commit and rolled
 *   the sandbox back. State is unchanged and NOTHING was persisted; the request itself FAILS
 *   (HTTP 409) — never 200-then-rollback (audit E3/D1). Carries only fault KINDS, never content.
 * - `StaleBeatError` — the compare-and-swap stale-write guard (0065 Part A): a mutating call carried
 *   an `expectedBeatSeq` that no longer matches the committed `beatSeq`, so the board moved under it
 *   (the 0064 queued-turn case). The write is REFUSED with NO state change — HTTP 409 with a stable
 *   `code: "stale-beat"`, the CURRENT `beatSeq`, and the Vault-free current board, so the caller can
 *   re-ground immediately. Distinct from `TurnRefusedError` (an integrity failure of an applied
 *   candidate); this refuses BEFORE the mutation, so nothing was ever applied to roll back.
 * - `PersistFailureError` — the durable save itself failed (disk full, I/O). Its own fault class,
 *   never misread as "degradation" and never fail-open (audit E7): the turn is rolled back, the
 *   message is sanitized (no paths), HTTP 500.
 *
 * Pure domain module: no I/O, importable by every layer (the outward HTTP transport included).
