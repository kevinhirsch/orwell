 * before it (0007's non-degradation lives in the snapshot's content, not in keeping
 * every historical file), and an unbounded file-per-mutation history is O(n²) disk.
 * We keep the newest `RETAIN_RECENT` versions plus the newest `RETAIN_CHECKPOINTS`
 * periodic checkpoints (every `CHECKPOINT_EVERY`th version) and prune the rest.
 *
 * Per-user directories are keyed by a hex encoding of the user id, so one user can
 * never read another's saves and no user-controlled string ever becomes a path
 * segment (no traversal). ENGINE-ONLY (persists souls + the hidden relationship
