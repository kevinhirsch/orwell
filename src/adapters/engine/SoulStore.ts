/**
 * ENGINE-ONLY soul store (feature 0024): per-houseguest dynamic Soul = a growing
 * markdown narrative + a per-houseguest vector index for SEMANTIC recall. Recall
 * runs over the FULL (hidden) soul engine-side; only pathway-filtered results ever
 * reach the player (0002). Holds Vault-side data — no outward module depends on it.
 *
 * `embed` is injected (the deterministic fake in tests; a real model at runtime).
 *
 * Lane G8 — a soul-write batch must let the event loop BREATHE. The real embedder
 * (ADR 0004) is a synchronous worker bridge: each `embed()` call blocks the Node
 * event loop for the inference. A bulk batch used to run every embed back-to-back
 * inside one synchronous call — pinning the loop for the whole batch, so `/health`
 * (and every concurrent request) stalled and the front-end reported a false outage.
 * The fix keeps BOTH contracts intact:
 *
 * - the AUTHORITATIVE soul (narrative + memories) still updates synchronously in
 *   `recordToSoul` — lossless, monotonic, snapshot-visible (0007/0030);
 * - each embed is still ONE synchronous call on the ADR 0004 seam — only the
 *   *spacing* changes: indexing is queued and drained one memory per macrotask
 *   (`setImmediate`), so the loop serves I/O between embed calls.
 *
 * Lane G12 — the breathing batch lane is SHARED process-wide, at the seam. G8's
 * queue/drain lived per instance: every SoulStore (one per user sandbox) ran its own
 * `setImmediate` chain, so N sandboxes flooding together — the boot preload restores
 * EVERY saved user (`composeRuntime`), several restores landing in one tick — put up
 * to N back-to-back embeds into a single check phase: stalls stacked to N × one
 * inference. The drain is now ONE module-wide lane, mirroring the one ONNX worker
 * that actually serves every sandbox (ADR 0004): the loop never carries more than a
 * single embed per macrotask NO MATTER how many sandboxes are bursting, and every
 * present or future burst site inherits the breathing by construction the moment it
 * calls `recordToSoul`:
 *
 *   - creation-time seeding (G8's original case — casting finalization, and the
 *     season-restart re-seeding through the one restart door, D1/R1);
 *   - `rebuildSoulIndex` replaying a whole season's arc on restore (0030), including
 *     the boot preload over every saved user;
 *   - the eviction-night / finale fold+confessional bursts and the per-turn
 *     off-screen tick (0040/0041 via `GameSessionAdapter`).
 *
 * Teardown hygiene (G12): when a sandbox is dropped or replaced (season reset,
 * rollback restore, LRU unload, a refused resume), `discardPending` drops ITS queued
 * index work — derived state for indexes about to be garbage — so a dead season's
 * backlog never delays a live one's drain or burns inference on the shared lane.
 *
 * Correctness: the vector index is DERIVED state. `recall` flushes any still-queued
 * memories for that houseguest (this store only) synchronously first, so a recall is
 * always complete — callers observe exactly the old semantics, just without the loop
 * pinned.
 *
 * PERSIST-1 / PERSIST-4 self-heal: `embed` may change WHICH provider it delegates to across the
 * life of one `SoulStore` (`engineRoot`'s embed closure now reads the live process-wide provider
 * on every call, so a sandbox built during the fastembed boot warm-up upgrades the moment warm-up
 * finishes, instead of being pinned to the deterministic fallback forever — the PERSIST-4 race). A
 * provider change means a houseguest's index can suddenly see a vector of a different dimension
 * than the one already indexed; `VectorIndex.upsert` is contractually required to THROW
 * `VectorDimMismatchError` rather than silently mix spaces (PERSIST-1). `indexOne` catches exactly
 * that error and self-heals: it discards the stale index and re-embeds the houseguest's WHOLE
 * memory history through the CURRENT embed function before retrying, so the index converges back
 * to one consistent space instead of ever holding two. This is a rare, one-time-per-transition
 * event (at most a couple of times per game), so the synchronous re-embed burst is an accepted
 * trade against the alternative — a permanently corrupted or permanently frozen index.
