/**
 * The runtime `Clock` (real-time purge 2026-07-10, PO ruling — replaces the deleted `SystemClock`,
 * and makes feature 0108's opt-in logical clock the ONLY clock). A **passive** virtual clock: it
 * starts at a FIXED epoch and advances ONLY when the composition explicitly steps it — once per
 * committed mutation (see `composeRuntime`). It NEVER reads `Date.now()`, so nothing in the game is
 * tied to real-world time — the house lives on the play-clock alone.
 *
 * Crucially `now()` is a pure READ and never advances the clock: read counts are wall-clock-paced
 * (the driver's quiesce polls) and must stay clock-neutral, so identical committed-mutation
 * sequences ⇒ identical clock sequences ⇒ identical tick behavior at any pacing (this is exactly
 * what made 0108's golden record/replay deterministic — now simply always-on). Deterministic and
 * run-to-run reproducible, unlike the old wall-clock source.
