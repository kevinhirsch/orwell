 *

 * act just as intentional as the player would be in terms of location selection."
 *
 * Where MOVEMENT_PERSONALITY bends HOW MUCH a houseguest roams (a trait), INTENT bends WHERE they go
 * (a goal): toward the room of whoever their relationship read points at — an ally to bond with, a
 * rival/target to work, a deal/bloc partner to honor — and (softly) AWAY from a pure threat they want
 * distance from. The pull is read off the relationship model (the caller supplies the per-candidate
 * "how much does THIS houseguest want to be in a room with THAT one, and with what valence" signal),
 * so when two end up together it is usually because ONE of them went looking for the other.
 *
 * CRITICAL — the calibration story is DIFFERENT from MOVEMENT_PERSONALITY's. Personality weighting had
 * to be calibration-NEUTRAL (cosmetic), so it rode a dedicated stream off the base. INTENT is
 * DELIBERATELY calibration-LOAD-BEARING: it changes who clusters → who the off-screen society pairs →
 * the relationship folds that feed votes. By owner ruling (0078) location is MEANT to affect play, so

 * weighting — it only RE-WEIGHTS the existing stay-gate threshold and the per-candidate destination
 * weights; it DRAWS NO rng of its own (one stay-gate draw + at most one destination draw, exactly as
 * before), so the per-NPC shared-stream draw COUNT is unchanged (the spine re-phases only by which
 * ROOM intent steers toward, which is precisely the change the calibration pass re-tunes for). All
