/**
 * Feature 0059 §5 — the organic SURFACING scheduler for hidden pre-game TIES (the DEFERRED follow-on).
 *
 * A seeded pre-game tie (two houseguests who knew each other before the show) exists at cast time but is
 * Vault-sealed from the player AND the admin. It surfaces to the house ONLY organically, exactly as
 * 0058's dormant story threads and 0077's closed-door whispers do: as the live edge between the pair
 * genuinely warms over weeks, a careful observer eventually NOTICES they are unusually close — that they
 * seem to already know each other — and a Vault-free belief diffuses NPC-to-NPC along the affinity graph
 * (0038). A chain that terminates at the player lands a player belief: the house tells the player about a
 * tie they didn't seed and couldn't see. NEVER a banner, never exposition, never the sealed `nature`.
 *
 * Knowledge vs. suspicion holds (0002): what the player comes to hold is a soft BELIEF formed from
 * observed behavior ("those two seem unusually tight, like they go way back"), a read they build their
 * own paranoia/trust around (0017) — they may suspect a pre-show connection long before (or without ever)
 * coming to know it. The sealed reason the two know each other never crosses; only that the house has
 * started to read them as close.
 *
 * CALIBRATION (sacred — mandate #4): this is TEXTURE, never the spine, and it is OPT-IN.
 *   • The caller (`GameSessionAdapter.advanceSeededTies`) runs this ONLY behind the default-OFF
 *     `ORWELL_SEEDED_TIE_SURFACING` flag, so the seeded juryReach / gradient / UAT sims (which set it
 *     nowhere) never enter this code at all — the off-screen tick is byte-identical to the pre-feature
 *     build (no extra draw, no extra event, no fold).
 *   • Even when ON, every roll here is on the caller's DEDICATED rng (off the game seed + a tick
 *     counter), never the shared society/competition/vote stream.
 *   • The NPC↔NPC diffusion runs WITHOUT a relationship fold (no `rel`/`subjects` to `diffuseGossip`) —
 *     pure position/warmth gossip that moves no edge. The §5 consequence fold (a discovered tie shifts
 *     third-party reads) is the caller's separate, flag-gated step — it never lives in the calibration
 *     baseline.
