/**
 * NPC CAMPAIGNS (feature 0085) — strategy executed over TIME, not one-tick impulses. A `Campaign` is a
 * houseguest's (or a bloc's) persistent, hidden, adaptive agenda: a GOAL aimed at a TARGET, pursued
 * across many beats and re-planned as the board shifts, until it resolves at a ceremony.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS PURE + ENGINE-ONLY (Vault-sealed). It holds hidden strategy and the per-perspective
 * `knownTo` set (the symmetric-perspective spine: a campaign is its owner's private knowledge — every
 * OTHER houseguest AND the player learns of it only through a pathway, never an omniscient read). No
 * outward surface may import it (dependency-cruiser). It draws no I/O; magnitude is seeded.
 *
 * Phase A (this slice) is the model + the PURE logic (`generateInfluence`, `formCampaigns`,
 * `campaignTilt`, `replan`), unit-tested in isolation and NOT yet wired into the live off-screen tick
 * or the seeded decision weights — so it is inert and cannot perturb calibration. Phase B wires
 * execution + the decision tilt (behind the calibration guard); Phase C the player surfacing + scramble.

// bounded, persistent `Campaign` the player owns — mirroring `formCampaigns`/`advanceCampaign` exactly

 * accrues (bounded `progressPerMove` ± jitter, exactly like an NPC's `advanceCampaign` tick) ONLY when
