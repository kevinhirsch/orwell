/**
 * TRIGGER SECRETS & HOUSE-EVENT ERUPTIONS (feature 0091) — the pure engine layer.
 *
 * A houseguest's volatile, sealed `trigger` hidden element (a buried temper, a grudge they smile
 * through, a desperate streak) stays inert until accumulated STRESS meets a fresh SPARK and a
 * temperature roll — then it FIRES, emitting an emergent, Vault-safe PUBLIC house event the player
 * witnesses (a screaming match, a showmance detonating, a mask slipping). The hidden attribute stays
 * sealed; only the eruption is seen (the inverse companion to 0075's confidences — there a sealed
 * attribute becomes player knowledge by being TOLD; here a different sealed attribute produces a
 * WITNESSED public consequence while the attribute itself stays fully hidden).
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS PURE + ENGINE-ONLY (Vault-sealed). It is HANDED the already-read soul signals + scene
 * signals; it holds NO Vault handle, does NO I/O, and (except `eruptionEvent`, which consults the
 * EventStore read-only for anti-repeat) reads only its arguments. The eruption-pool LINE it returns is
 * a GENERIC, name-free, sealed-wording-free public scene type — the model dresses it in its own voice
 * from the public board (mandate #3: the model never selects a trigger, never reads the sealed
 * attribute, never invents one). No outward surface may import this (dependency-cruiser).
 *
 * Calibration (the load-bearing guarantee, mandate's determinism callout): `shouldFire` draws exactly
 * ONE rng value, on the DEDICATED session side-rng the orchestrator hands it — NEVER the shared tick
 * stream that resolves the seeded society/vote/comp spine. With `ORWELL_TRIGGERS` off (the default) the
 * orchestrator never calls in here at all ⇒ zero draws ⇒ the calibration harness is byte-identical.
