/**
 * Feature 0063 — the casting diversity floor: engine-guaranteed FLOORS (BIPOC ≥ MIN_BIPOC, LGBTQ+ ≥
 * MIN_QUEER, gender roughly balanced, ages spread across bands), an ethnicity-grounded identity facet,
 * and a character-driven sexual-orientation model split across the Vault Wall by DISCLOSURE.
 *
 * RNG ISOLATION (the #338 lesson — CRITICAL): EVERY diversity-attribute draw (ethnicity / gender /
 * orientation / disclosure) runs on a DEDICATED, isolated seeded sub-stream forked off the cast seed via
 * `hashSeed`, NEVER the shared house/competition/vote stream. These attributes are DESCRIPTIVE ONLY —
 * they never feed a competition, a vote, or any outcome — so the public competition/vote sequence is
 * byte-for-byte unchanged with or without them. (Verified by the juryReach gate + a golden test.)
 *
 * VALIDATE / REPAIR (the L28 caps' symmetric operation): the layer is DEALT off the sub-stream, then a
 * post-pass CHECKS each floor and REPAIRS the minimum number of picks to satisfy it (swap the next
 * legal-ish draw, never spin — the same guard-budget discipline `spreadFacet` uses). Deterministic per
 * seed and player-INDEPENDENT (the sub-stream keys off the cast's seeded NAMES, never the player).
 *
 * THE VAULT SPLIT: the layer returns PUBLIC facets (ethnicity, gender presentation, an out orientation)
 * that fold onto the byte-stable public Character, AND a HIDDEN `privateOrientations` map (closeted /
 * not-yet-out houseguests) that the caller seals into the Vault — it NEVER appears on any player or
 * admin projection until a 0002 pathway surfaces it.
