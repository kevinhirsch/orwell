/**
 * RELATIONSHIP TRAJECTORIES (feature 0087) — a directed bond has MOMENTUM, not just a position.
 *
 * Alongside the 0002 directed edge (`EdgeSignals` — the POSITION) the engine keeps a small, hidden,
 * engine-owned MOMENTUM term: the direction the bond is MOVING. It biases off-screen scene-NATURE
 * selection so consecutive scenes between a pair tend to CONTINUE the arc (a curdling friendship gets
 * more clash scenes as it cools) rather than whiplash bond → clash → bond.
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS PURE + ENGINE-ONLY (Vault-sealed). It takes NO rng — momentum is a deterministic read
 * of already-folded history — does NO I/O, and holds NO Vault handle. `phase`/`momentum` are Vault-class
 * hidden state (mandate #2): they appear on NO player- or admin-facing projection and reach the player
 * ONLY through behavior (the kinds of scenes that happen, the tone the model voices). No outward surface
 * may import this (dependency-cruiser).
 *
 * The single behavioral mechanism is `tiltNatureWeights`: it RE-WEIGHTS the existing `natureWeights`
 * propensities toward natures that continue the current `phase`, scaled by `momentum`, BOUNDED by a
 * tunable cap (`TRAJECTORY_CONSTANTS.tiltCap`). It adds ZERO rng draws and consumes none — the same
 * single nature `weightedPick` happens, only its weights differ — so with trajectories ON the off-screen
 * stream's draw count/order is unchanged and the seeded competition/vote spine reading that same stream
 * stays in phase (the calibration-neutrality constraint; `tests/unit/trajectoryOutcomeNeutral.test.ts`).
