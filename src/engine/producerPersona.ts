 * explicitly NOT a houseguest:
 *   · OFF-CAMERA — the unseen producer voice across the casting table. It has NO headshot/portrait
 *     and never appears in "The Cast", the roster, the portrait pipeline, or whereabouts.
 *   · NOT one of the 16 — it is never in `GameHouse.npcs`, never seeded into relationships, never
 *     in the house, never witnessed by anyone in the game.
 *
 * It is a persistent, SEEDED (reproducible) persona with a distinct personality/voice that the
 * casting interview voices CONSISTENTLY (the same seed → the same producer, across turns and a
 * restart). Everything here is PUBLIC voice material (facts to voice, ADR 0003) — the producer is
 * a GM-voice entity, not a houseguest with secret game state, so nothing here is Vault content.
 *
 * The flags below are structural assertions the exclusion tests read: a producer is, by
 * construction, off-camera, portrait-less, and not a houseguest.
