/**
 * The house WHISPERS about closed-door pairings — the 0077 NPC-side increment (the conspicuousness
 * read, but for the HOUSE, not just the player). When two NPCs are conspicuously holed up together in a
 * private room, a plausibly-positioned third houseguest notices and a Vault-free POSITION suspicion
 * (who slipped off where — NEVER what they said) rises and diffuses NPC-to-NPC along the affinity graph,
 * exactly like a scene rumor (0038). A chain that terminates at the player lands a player belief: the
 * house tells the player about pairings they didn't witness themselves.
 *
 * CALIBRATION (sacred): this is TEXTURE, never the spine. The caller hands a DEDICATED rng (never the
 * shared society/competition/vote stream), and the diffusion runs WITHOUT a relationship fold (no
 * `rel`/`subjects` to `diffuseGossip`) — so it moves no edge and consumes no shared draw. The seeded
 * `juryReach` + gradient outcomes are byte-identical with this on or off (proven by the heavy sims).
 * Vault Wall: only the observable FACT of a meeting crosses, through a modeled pathway — never the
 * sealed scene; paranoia stays the player's to form (0017).
