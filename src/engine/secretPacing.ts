/**
 * Feature 0092 — secret-pacing drip: the PURE pacing/eligibility core. NO I/O, NO Vault handle — it is
 * handed the ALREADY-READ relationship edges (both ways) + the threads' sealed lifecycle status, and it
 * returns only a re-ranking + a budget decision. It surfaces NOTHING itself: the adapter routes the top
 * eligible candidate into 0060's EXISTING anchored surface-to-player path (gossip / `surfaceInformationTo`
 * / the 0075 confidant slip). The drip changes ONLY *which* already-Wall-safe secret 0060 picks and
 * *whether* the weekly budget allows it — never the crossing odds, never the content, never a number.
 *
 * Determinism: this module is a pure function of its inputs (no rng of its own — the SEEDED eligibility
 * roll lives in the adapter, on a DEDICATED side rng that never touches the shared society/competition/
 * vote stream). Same edges + same lifecycle ⇒ same ripeness ranking ⇒ same drip decisions (§"determinism").
 *
 * The Vault Wall is preserved by construction: ripeness reads only the engine's OWN relationship reads
 * and the thread's sealed status — it is NEVER shown; only a re-ranking of 0060's surface decision
 * crosses, and that crossing is the unchanged anchored belief/paraphrase 0060 already produces (§7).
