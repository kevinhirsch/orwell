/**
 * Character evolution & season arc (feature 0041) — the LIVE emotional layer.
 *
 * A season should *change* a houseguest. Consequential events move their hidden soul
 * `emotionalState` (a 0..1 confidence−distress scalar; 0.5 = calm baseline) and `volatility`;
 * a calm stretch mean-reverts them toward baseline. This is the sibling to the 0028
 * competition emotional modifier — it reuses the SAME tunable constants
 * (`emotional.volatilityScale`, `meanReversionRate`, `baseline`), so the game's "swing"
 * retunes in one place. It is BOUNDED ([0,1]) and never overrides a hard rule (0005) or the
 * Vault Wall (0001) — the player feels the change only through later behavior, never a number.
 *
 * Only the dynamic SOUL drifts; the static CHARACTER baseline is untouched (0007).
