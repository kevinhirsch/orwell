 * and carries a Vault-free narrative scaffold the narrator (0018) dresses — premise, beats, and how
 * a win reads. The library NEVER picks a winner (anti-sycophancy): `resolveCompetition` still
 * decides from stats + bounded temperature + the soul emotional modifier + intent.
 *
 * Tunable content, like `richnessConfig` / the temperature constants: add or reword defs freely —
 * the tests pin the structure (governing === the resolution map's stat for the def's type; ids
 * unique; both phases stocked), not the flavor.

/**
 * Feature 0126 — the EXPANDED mechanic pool. 0125's theme layer reskins the SAME ~12 mechanics, so a
 * season still repeats each mechanic ~2×; this adds 9 HOH + 9 veto NEW mechanics so a full season (~14
 * HOH + ~13 veto comps) can run with essentially no repeated MECHANIC (not just no repeated skin). The
 * new defs preserve the base pool's governing-stat MIX per phase (physical ~33% / mental ~53% / social
 * ~13%) so the competition balance — and thus the seeded calibration distribution — stays stable.
 *
 * OPT-IN, default-off (`ORWELL_COMP_MECHANICS_PLUS`, threaded via `SeasonCtx.expandedComps`): adding
 * mechanics changes WHICH def a fixed seed draws each week, and the def's `type` selects the resolution
 * stat, so it changes seeded winners (the documented COMP-4 cost). With the flag off the draw pool is the
 * bare base 12 ⇒ every seeded gate (juryReach / gradient / UAT / golden / the fixed-seed 0043 BDD) is
 * byte-identical. The deploy turns it on for real play; a flag-on calibration sanity proves the band holds.
