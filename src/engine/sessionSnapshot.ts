/**
 * PERSIST-8 — the 0031 checkpoint's `GameState` projection (above) is deliberately engine-agnostic

 * added. That left a real coverage gap: a regression in any of them was invisible to the fail-closed
 * non-degradation gate. These two functions are the engine-layer companion to `saveState.ts`'s
 * `counts`/`isSuperset` — SAME discipline (append-only ⇒ id/subset presence, monotonic accumulators ⇒
 * non-decreasing counts), applied directly to the `SessionSnapshot` (never routed through `GameState`,
 * so `src/domain` stays engine-type-free).
 *
 * ONLY dimensions with a verified append-only/monotonic contract in `GameSessionAdapter` are covered.
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED (checked against the source, not guessed) because they are legitimately
 * mutable CURRENT state — the mandate's "never thins" promise was never made for them, and guarding
 * them would fault on ordinary play:
 *   - `campaigns` / `drives` — pruned/rebuilt wholesale every `campaignTick` (finished or owner-evicted
 *     campaigns are filtered OUT; `drives` is fully replaced each tick).
 *   - `trajectories` / `trajectoryFolds` — an arc that decays to `steady` is deliberately DELETED
 *     ("dropped … and forgotten", `decayUntouchedTrajectories`); the fold ring buffer is capped to
 *     `recencyWindow` (oldest entries shifted out).
 *   - `alliances` — dissolves (removed from the list) the moment membership drops below two.
 *   - `storyThreads` — an authored profile update REPLACES a source's whole thread set (filter-then-
 *     concat), so thread ids do not persist stably.
 *   - `secretPlayerBluffBelief` — a resolved bluff removes the caught subject from the belief list.
 *   - `presence` / `presenceBase` / `presenceTenure` / `presenceZone` / `trackedSightings` /
 *     `readAnchors` — current-position / per-week snapshot state, overwritten by design every tick/week
 *     (like `ceremony`/`live`, already outside the checkpoint).
 *   - `pacingDripCount` (resets every new week by design; `pacingDripWeek` moves with it).
 *   - `approachCooldown` / `approachShown` (issue #1322) — the per-NPC remaining-stretches counter
 *     legitimately counts back DOWN to 0 and drops out of the map as the cooldown lapses, and the
 *     shown-initiators record is fully replaced each stretch, by design (like `presence` above) —
 *     neither is a monotonic accumulator.
 * Season boundaries (a brand-new game or the one sanctioned restart door) are exempt structurally: the
 * orchestrator only ever diffs a baseline against a LATER candidate of the SAME season — a season's
 * first commit has no baseline at all (`Orchestrator.commitPlayerTurn`), so a reset-to-empty at season
 * start is never seen as a "later" snapshot thinning an "earlier" one.
