 * the initiator (`partner→initiator`); the initiator's OWN edge toward the people they just engaged
 * never budges. That is correct for the engine's off-screen society (an NPC bystander's belief
 * moving is enough) — but on the PLAYER channel it left `player→NPC` frozen at its move-in scatter
 * forever, under every mutual-bond gate `formAlliance`/`joinAlliance` (0107) and bloc detection
 * (0043) read, making them ~unreachable however much the player genuinely engaged.
 *
 * ADR 0002 holds the engine computes BOTH `NPC→player` and `player→NPC` from history (never a
 * number the player sees) — so when the PLAYER is the initiator of a `kind`-tagged scene, this
 * reciprocates a BOUNDED SHARE (`RECIPROCAL_SHARE`, always < 1 — the player's own read should firm
 * up more slowly than a houseguest's memorable read of the player) of the SAME engine-owned `kind`
 * impact onto `initiator→partner`, through the identical proven update rule (disposition × jitter ×
 * clamp). It spends NO new budget: `partners` is the list the caller ALREADY metered against the
 * per-beat-per-edge fold budget (E21) for the other direction, so this can never become a second,
 * unbounded pump lever.
 *
 * Scoped to PLAYER-initiated scenes only — a no-op for any other initiator. An NPC-initiated scene
 * reaching this channel already folds the reverse via `foldHiddenImpact`'s own partner pass (the
 * "other witness" IS the player in that case); live NPC-initiated calls don't happen today anyway
 * (`frontend/src/tool_implementations.py`'s `do_record_interaction` always sends `initiator: player`).
 * Draws its OWN rng — the isolated player-channel `commands:` stream `EngineCommandsAdapter` already
 * uses for overhears, never the main season/competition/vote stream, so this cannot perturb the
 * seeded calibration spine (`tests/property/juryReach.property.test.ts` never calls
 * `recordInteraction`, and the gradient gate's only exposure is its own isolated stream too).

 * Maeve is the bigger threat." Three invariants hold this to the same discipline as every other
 * fold:
 *
 *  • I3 / Vault Wall (witness-gated): `holder` must be in `witnessSet` — a belief can only form
 *    from what was actually witnessed. An entry naming an absent holder is SILENTLY DROPPED, never
 *    minting an off-screen read from the player channel (off-screen life is the engine's alone to
 *    mint, `EngineCommandsAdapter`'s own player-witness invariant).
 *  • Anti-sycophancy #3 (engine owns the amount): `direction`/`emphasis` pick a member of the SAME
 *    closed sets `foldGenerativeConsequence` uses; the actual delta is the engine's own base scaled
 *    by a bounded, seeded TRUST GATE (the proven shape `campaignTilt` already uses, 0085) — a holder
 *    who barely trusts the initiator moves near the `trustFloor`, a trusted initiator's pitch lands
 *    closer to the full bounded amount. No raw number ever crosses from the caller.
 *  • I2 / anti-sycophancy (can fail or backfire): when `holder` doesn't trust the initiator AND
 *    already has a STRONGER bond with `about` than with the initiator, the pitch is at risk of
 *    reading as transparent manipulation — a seeded roll may BACKFIRE it: instead of moving
 *    holder→about at all, a small bounded hit lands on holder→initiator ("that felt like being
 *    worked"). A social move is never an auto-success lever.
 *
 * Rides the caller-supplied `spend(holder, about)` budget (the SAME per-beat-per-edge anti-pump
 * spend `EngineCommandsAdapter` already uses, keyed `holder->about` instead of `holder->initiator`)
 * so a scene can't spam a huge third-party swing. Pure aside from the injected `rng`; never mutates
 * its inputs beyond the relationship model's own proven update rule.
