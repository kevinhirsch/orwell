/**
 * Feature 0103 — edit-bay foreshadowing: the PURE fit/eligibility/hint core. NO I/O, NO Vault handle — it
 * is handed the ALREADY-READ, Vault-free SHAPE of the in-motion pathways (their motion status + the sealed
 * fit signals reduced to [0,1] reads + the PUBLIC observation to hang a hint on) and returns only a
 * re-ranking + a budget decision + a Vault-safe hint. It surfaces NOTHING itself: the adapter routes the
 * top eligible candidate into the EXISTING 0049/0002 anchored observation pathway + the `momentPrompts`
 * `editBayHint` field. The layer changes ONLY *which* Vault-safe observation the narrator is offered and
 * *whether* the weekly budget allows it this tick — it folds NO relationship weight, advances NO pathway,
 * and NEVER commits a seeded outcome (a foreshadowed campaign can still fail — the fake-out is a feature).
 *
 * Determinism: pure function of its inputs (no rng of its own — the SEEDED eligibility roll lives in the
 * adapter, on a DEDICATED side rng that never touches the shared society/competition/vote stream). Same
 * shapes ⇒ same fit ranking ⇒ same decisions.
 *
 * The Vault Wall is preserved by construction: `foreshadowFit` reads only reduced [0,1] signals and is
 * NEVER shown; a hint carries only the PUBLIC `observation` string + a tone word — never the pathway's
 * sealed premise, target, plan, or a number. It is strictly LESS than a 0092 drip (which eventually crosses
 * an anchored belief); a hint crosses only *that the camera lingered*.
