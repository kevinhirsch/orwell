/**
 * T0-6 — the ONE generic closed-facet-diff validator at the `recordCastProfile` boundary.
 *
 * Replaces the per-facet regex guard that used to live inline in `GameSessionAdapter.recordCastProfile`
 * (the 2026-07-21 #1768 INK-BUDGET backstop): that guard was hand-written for exactly one closed facet
 * (visible ink) and only ever scanned `physicalCharacteristics` fields, never the biography prose — so a
 * tattoo mention smuggled into the authored BIOGRAPHY bypassed it entirely. This module is table-driven —
 * a future closed facet (region, vocation family, …) is one registry row, not a new hand-rolled guard —
 * and it checks BOTH the structured facet fields and the free-text biography.
 *
 * ADR 0005's spirit: this validates CLOSED facets only (a dealt, immutable per-houseguest budget) — it
 * never touches open-set prose meaning, only whether the authored material CONTRADICTS a fixed fact the
 * casting office already committed. A skeleton that granted a dimension (e.g. an inked slot) leaves the
 * author free to sharpen it however they like; only a skeleton that did NOT grant it is guarded.
 *
 * T9 (owner resiliency ruling, 2026-07-21): the demoted per-facet regex (`INK_RE`) is preserved here —
 * never deleted — as an ALARMED MONITOR: `monitorLegacyInkGuard` re-runs it after this generic validator
 * has already corrected the record, and it is a canary, not a corrector. If it ever still finds ink on a
 * no-ink skeleton post-guard, that is a real gap in the generic validator, and it alarms loudly
 * (`console.warn`) rather than silently re-fixing it — demote → observe → delete-never.
