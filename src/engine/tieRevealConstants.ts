/**
 * Feature 0095 — the single tunable module for the pre-show-tie REVEAL pathways (the `GOSSIP` /
 * `CONFIDENCE` / `SEEDED_TIE_SURFACING` sibling — the B59 grep gate covers it). Every gate + the
 * per-season exposure cap the reveal pathways read live here; no magic number at a call site.
 *
 * SCOPE: this governs the pre-show-TIE reveal (0095) — a SEPARATE, distinct gate/rng stream from 0059
 * §5's `SEEDED_TIE_SURFACING` (`seededRelationshipConstants.ts`), which deliberately produces only
 * AMBIENT "these two seem close" suspicion and never confirms the sealed connection or folds a
 * betrayal-grade consequence. 0095 is the reveal that actually lets the sealed fact come out and pay
 * off — a new, separate pathway, not a mode of §5's scheduler.
 *
 * CALIBRATION (sacred — mandate #4): every roll is on a DEDICATED rng (never the shared society/
 * competition/vote stream), and the whole pathway is OPT-IN behind a default-OFF flag
 * (`ORWELL_TIE_REVEAL`). Off (the default, and the state the seeded juryReach/gradient/UAT sims run
 * in) ⇒ zero draws, zero folds, zero exposures — byte-identical to the pre-feature build.
