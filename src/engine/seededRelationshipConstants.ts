/**
 * Feature 0059 §5 — the organic SURFACING scheduler tunables for the hidden seeded-relationship layer
 * (pre-game ties + showmances). The single home for every magnitude the per-tick tie scheduler reads,
 * in the sibling-constants pattern (`relationshipConstants` / `threadConstants` / `presenceConstants`):
 * no magic number at a call site, all God-Mode-knobbable later (0016 count-only).
 *
 * SCOPE: these govern only the PRE-GAME-TIE surfacing scheduler (§5). The SHOWMANCE arc
 * (spark→bond→visible) is carried by `SHOWMANCE_BOND_AFFINITY` / `SHOWMANCE_VISIBLE_AFFINITY` in
 * `seededRelationships.ts` and surfaces at `visible` (a PUBLIC house fact) — that half ships in the
 * 0059 core. What was DEFERRED, and lives here, is the tie's organic DISCOVERY: a careful observer
 * notices two houseguests are unusually close / seem to already know each other, recorded as an
 * ordinary 0002 belief — never the sealed `nature`, never a banner.
 *
 * CALIBRATION (sacred — mandate #4): every roll the scheduler makes is on a DEDICATED rng (never the
 * shared society/competition/vote stream), and the whole scheduler is OPT-IN behind a default-OFF flag
 * (`ORWELL_SEEDED_TIE_SURFACING`). With the flag off — the default, and the state the seeded juryReach /
 * gradient / UAT sims run in — `advanceSeededTies` returns immediately, drawing nothing and folding
 * nothing, so the off-screen draw count/order and every seeded outcome are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
 * pre-feature build (`tests/unit/seededTieSurfacing.test.ts` is the neutrality gate). The discovery
 * FOLD (§5 — a discovered tie shifts third-party reads via 0023) moves edges, so it is reachable ONLY
 * behind the flag; it never runs in the calibration baseline.
