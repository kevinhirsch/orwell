/**
 * Feature 0107 — NAMED ALLIANCES. An explicit, NAMED, multi-party pact layered over the emergent bloc
 * (0043) + deal (0039) systems. The point is the *name*: in Big Brother, naming an alliance cements it
 * "in reality" — real or not. So a named alliance does three things, all bounded:
 *
 *   1. CEMENT — a small per-pair TIE BOOST added to co-members' mutual bond in `detectBlocs`, so naming
 *      pulls a borderline cluster together and tightens it. But the real bonds still rule: the boost is
 *      bounded, so a HOLLOW alliance over weak bonds never reaches the bloc threshold — it stays hollow.
 *   2. FAVOR — a bounded GOODWILL bump toward each co-ally (feeds the 0075 confidence ledger): naming an
 *      alliance is an easy way to bank a little good favor with the people in it.
 *   3. STAKES — betraying a NAMED co-ally is a heavier betrayal than breaking an unspoken bond (a
 *      multiplier on the reconciliation demerit): putting it on record raises the cost of breaking it.
 *
 * SATURATION DILUTES (the owner's "the show has too many alliances that mean nothing"): the more
 * alliances a houseguest piles into, the less each one cements — so a tight, exclusive pact beats a web
 * of overlapping ones. Pure + deterministic; Vault-only (the cement/favor magnitudes never cross to the
 * player — they see the NAME + members, never a number).
