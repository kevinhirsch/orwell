 * (fewer living/awake NPCs than the caller's `count`) still fills out. Relative order is preserved
 * WITHIN each group, so the relationship signal keeps deciding who leads among whoever is actually
 * eligible — this only stops the single top NPC from monopolizing every stretch.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT folded into `rankApproaches` itself: that function stays pure (no cooldown
 * concept, no new rng draws) so any other reader of it — today there are none in production code;
 * only this module's own BDD/unit tests call it directly — can never be perturbed by a rotation rule
 * that only makes sense for the one player-facing approach surface
 * (`GameSessionAdapter.socialInitiatives`). Pure and rng-free: applying it never touches any seeded
