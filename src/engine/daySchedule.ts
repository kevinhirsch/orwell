 * clock reaches that time the ceremony fires + gathers the whole house (the 0106 set-piece). This module
 * is the pure, deterministic, Vault-free schedule: a beat→phase map and two reads over the live state.
 *
 * It is a PURE READ — it never mutates the seeded sim, so everything built on it is calibration-identical,
 * and it is only ever SURFACED when the per-conversation clock is live (so golden replay, which pins that
 * clock off, never sees it — no re-record). In-game time only; never a wall clock.
