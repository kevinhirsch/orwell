/**
 * Feature 0095 — the pre-show-TIE REVEAL pathway (the OVERHEAR route). A SEPARATE, distinct module from
 * 0059 §5's `seededTieSurfacing.ts`, which deliberately produces only ambient "these two seem close"
 * suspicion and folds nothing but a mild third-party re-read. This module is the time-bomb going off:
 * when a sealed tie's pair are conspicuously close, an observer catches the REAL connection (the actual
 * pre-show fact, not a vague hunch). The DIRECT witness (the observer) takes the full, near-confidence
 * `BETRAYAL_SHOCK` blow (0026) — a genuine betrayal-grade read, folded once, directly. Anyone the belief
 * DIFFUSES to afterward rides the EXISTING `GOSSIP_HEARD.betrayal` hearsay nudge (confidence-scaled, the
 * same small "about to turn on someone" fold any gossip already applies) — a fifth-hand rumor barely
 * registers, exactly the discipline `gossipFolds.test.ts`'s bounded-nudge gate holds every GOSSIP_HEARD
 * entry to; the strong fold belongs to direct witnessing, never to hearsay.
 *
 * CALIBRATION (sacred — mandate #4): the caller (`GameSessionAdapter.advanceTieReveal`) runs this ONLY
 * behind the default-OFF `ORWELL_TIE_REVEAL` flag, on a DEDICATED rng (never the shared society/
 * competition/vote stream) — so with it off, or with no eligible tie, the seeded juryReach/gradient/UAT
 * sims never enter this code at all (byte-identical to the pre-feature build).
