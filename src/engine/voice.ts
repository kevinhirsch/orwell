/**
 * Character VOICE & grounded MOOD (feature 0084). Two halves of "sixteen mouths, not one":
 *
 *  • VOICE — a byte-stable PUBLIC fingerprint on the static `CHARACTER` (how a houseguest TALKS:
 *    register, rhythm, energy, directness, humor, and what their voice does under stress, plus a
 *    prose signature + a light habitual lexicon). Generated once at cast time, seeded + archetype-
 *    correlated but independently varied, so two of an archetype still sound different. It is identity
 *    and NEVER drifts (owner ruling 2026-06-25) — all the turn-to-turn dynamism lives in `mood`.
 *
 *  • MOOD — a Vault-safe, observable AFFECT WORD derived live from the soul. It runs on TWO timescales:
 *    the ACUTE state (`emotionalState`, which spikes on a beat and mean-reverts within a few turns) and
 *    the MARINATED baseline (the trend of `emotionalHistory` — the set-point the ~3-month season has
 *    dragged them to). Someone ground down over weeks reads as worn even on a calm day; a long safe run
 *    reads as lasting ease. Never a number, never the hidden CAUSE — only the carriage.
 *
 * Pure + deterministic (seeded). No I/O, no Vault: voice is public, mood is an observable word.
