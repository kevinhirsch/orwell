/**
 * Feature 0104 — season-over-season NOTORIETY: a reputation that precedes the returning player into a
 * NEW cast. PURE engine module (no I/O, NO Vault handle by construction): it is handed already-read
 * OPEN-SET facts (placement, the vote/eviction record, the relationship trajectory at each eviction,
 * comp wins, jury respect — all facts the player witnessed or was told, all the 0048 retrospective
 * already unseals) and returns a small, bounded `NotorietySummary` + a bounded, seeded day-one bias.
 *
 * The bright line (read first): what crosses the season door is a BOUNDED SUMMARY, never raw Vault
 * state — no soul, no hidden edge, no other houseguest's secret, no off-screen scene (mandate #2). The
 * finished season's Vault stays sealed on disk; the summary is computed ALONGSIDE it, never FROM it.
 * And the engine still owns every outcome magnitude (mandate #3): notoriety nudges the DIRECTION of the
 * new cast's NPC→player day-one reads — inside the existing move-in scatter envelope — and NOTHING else.
 *
 * Determinism (mandate #4): `notorietyBias` runs on the EXISTING day-one seeded rng (same seed + same
 * notoriety ⇒ same biased edges), and with no summary / `weight = 0` every bias is exactly 0 ⇒
 * `seedFirstImpressions` is byte-identical and the calibration spine is unmoved.
