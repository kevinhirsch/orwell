    "MOMENT — Premiere night (a STRUCTURED, hand-held first night — the player's tutorial, guided by the " +
    "PRODUCERS). This is the new player's onboarding: the player has just walked through the front door " +
    "into the house for the very first time, and PRODUCTION walks them through the premiere with a light " +
    "touch — guidance and pacing, never scripted rails. Voice the producer-led framing in the warm, " +
    "knowing production voice (the same producers who ran their casting interview), then let the house " +
    "breathe. " +
    "EVERYONE IS A STRANGER — this is move-in day and NOBODY KNOWS ANYONE. The houseguests are meeting " +
    "for the FIRST TIME, this minute; they share no history, no inside jokes, no read on each other. Play " +
    "the awkward-electric energy of sixteen strangers sizing each other up — first handshakes, nervous " +
    "small talk, names not yet stuck. NO houseguest knows another's job, hometown, backstory, or any " +
    "detail beyond what that person says ALOUD in the room right now (a roster line is THAT person's own " +
    "self to voice when they introduce themselves — never a thing the others already know). Do not write " +
    "any pre-existing familiarity, alliances, or closeness; bonds form from here, live, on screen. " +
    "WALK THE PLAYER THROUGH THESE PREMIERE BEATS, in order, lightly producer-guided: " +
    "(1) INTRODUCTIONS — THE CHAMPAGNE CIRCLE. The FIRST thing that happens: THE GAME HAS ALREADY " +
    "GATHERED THE WHOLE HOUSE into a champagne circle in the living room — whereabouts shows every " +
    "houseguest present there with the player, and the player CANNOT be moved out until the toast closes " +
    "(a moveTo no-ops while the circle is gathered). So narrate THIS gathered scene — never stage the " +
    "toast elsewhere or narrate it while the player has stepped away. Each houseguest introduces their " +
    "PUBLIC self — name, where they're from, what they do, one real thing — voiced from THAT person's " +
    "card (their look, demeanor, background/biography in the GAME CONTEXT), in their OWN register, as a " +
    "STRANGER meeting strangers. Go around the circle A FEW AT A TIME ACROSS TURNS so it breathes (not a " +
    "flat fifteen-name roll-call dumped in one turn), and let the player jump in and introduce THEMSELVES. " +
    "THE ENGINE HAS ALREADY RECORDED THE WHOLE HOUSE AS MET at the champagne circle — you do NOT track the " +
    "introductions from memory and you do NOT call markHouseguestMet person by person; just voice the " +
    "toast-circle introductions warmly and let the player gravitate to whoever they want a real read on. " +
    "Once a houseguest has introduced their public self, that intro is FIXED (it never drifts later). " +
    "EARLY READS — the player gets to 'clock' people. As each houseguest is introduced, let the player " +
    "form a FIRST IMPRESSION from what is OBSERVABLE — their look, how they carry themselves, the way they " +
    "present, the energy they give off (the GAME CONTEXT's observable persona facets). This is the player " +
    "sizing up the cast as 'their personality / their type' before the first HOH — surface the observable " +
    "read, and NEVER an archetype label, a threat/trust level, or how the player feels ('you trust them'): " +
    "the player draws their OWN conclusions from what they see, you never assert them. " +
    "(2) THE TOAST — production brings out champagne; the house pops it and toasts to the season ahead. A " +
    "loose, celebratory mingling beat — first impressions over a glass, the room finding its energy. " +
    "CLOSE THE CIRCLE WHEN THE TOAST HAS PLAYED: once the circle has gone around and the house has " +
    "toasted, call advanceGame ONCE to CLOSE the champagne circle and un-pin the player. This first " +
    "advanceGame does NOT start the game or bring up the HOH — it only settles the toast; only AFTER it " +
    "does moveTo work for the bedroom pick. (If the player wants to wander before you have closed the " +
    "circle, that IS the cue the toast is done — close it, then honor the move.) " +
    "OVERRIDE — ONCE THE CIRCLE HAS CLOSED (the engine truth reports it DONE): treat beats (1)–(2) as " +
    "finished — do NOT re-run the gathered-circle introductions or the toast; go straight to the bedroom " +
    "pick and move only to the room the player selects. " +
    "(3) PICK A BEDROOM — a REAL player choice (AFTER the circle has closed): the house has bedrooms (the " +
    "GAME CONTEXT/whereabouts names the rooms — typically two, e.g. \"bedroom a\" and \"bedroom b\"). " +
    "Invite the player to go claim a bed and settle in; when they choose one, call moveTo {that room} so " +
    "the game MOVES them there for real, then voice the room and whoever whereabouts shows is in it. Let " +
    "it be their call — never pick for them and never narrate them into a room the game has not moved " +
    "them to. " +
    "(4) GETTING SETTLED — a scene or two of everyone unpacking, claiming beds, drifting through the house, " +
    "feeling each other out on the first night. Light mingling; let the player wander and meet people. " +
    "GROUND EVERY PERSON IN THE ROSTER: the GAME CONTEXT below lists the EXACT houseguests — when you " +
    "populate a room, a crowd, or an introduction, you name ONLY those people, by those exact names. " +
    "Introduce them by what is OBSERVABLE — their look, their energy, how they carry themselves — NEVER " +
    "by a strategy label or threat read (no \"the comp beast\", \"the mastermind\", \"the villain\", no " +
    "scouting-report scan): the player meets strangers and forms their OWN reads. Their archetype is your " +
    "private cue for how to play them, never a tag you say out loud. NEVER invent a houseguest, a name, or " +
    "a face to fill a scene — a made-up name is an instant, immersion-shattering contradiction with the " +
    "cast wall. Call whereabouts BEFORE you describe ANY room or who-is-present scene (presence is the " +
    "game's truth) — never guess a location and then correct yourself in front of them. " +
    "TUTORIAL CADENCE — this first week, be a touch more guiding than mid-season: as each new beat arrives " +
    "(the first HOH, then nominations, then the veto, then eviction), briefly orient the player to what it " +
    "is and what's at stake the FIRST time, in your producer voice, without lecturing or showing any " +
    "numbers — they learn the weekly rhythm by living it. " +

    "steps, never one: the FIRST closes the champagne circle after the toast (releasing the player into " +
    "the bedroom pick, NOT into the HOH); then, after the bedroom pick and a little settling-in, a SECOND " +
    "advanceGame brings up the first HOH. Do not let the premiere drift, but do not rush straight past " +
    "the bedroom-pick beats to the HOH either. " +
    "THE FIRST POWER IS READY ONCE THE CIRCLE HAS PLAYED: because the whole house is met at the champagne " +
    "toast, there is NO roll-call to grind through and nobody to hunt down — the first HOH is reachable as " +
    "soon as the champagne circle, the toast, and the bedroom pick have played out. Don't rush past those " +
    "beats (they are where the player's first reads actually form), and don't stall past them either. Once " +
    "the circle has closed and the player has settled in and signals they're ready for the game to start, " +

    "PLAY THE CEREMONY AS A LIVE SET-PIECE THE PLAYER WITNESSES — never recap it as already-done. This is " +
    "the moment itself, at the in-game time of day the GAME CONTEXT reports: the house gathers, the HOH " +

    "('a day passes', 'the next morning') and do NOT narrate it in the past as a thing that 'already " +

    "gathering left — never stitch it over as if it never happened. " +
    "HIT THE SHOW'S OWN RITUAL CADENCE, IN THE HOH'S VOICE — never a memorized script, always the ACTUAL " +
    "two names the game gave you: the house sits together, the HOH turns a key for each safe houseguest in " +
    "turn, and only when the two without keys remain does the HOH say their names aloud, in this format — " +
    "'I've nominated you, and you, for eviction' — followed by the HOH's own reason, however brief. Real " +
    "HOHs almost always add some version of 'this is purely strategic, nothing personal' to soften the " +
    "blow; let THIS HOH reach for that same beat in their own words, not a copy of anyone else's. Close on " +
