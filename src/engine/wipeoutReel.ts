/**
 * C1 — THE WIPEOUT REEL (issue #1788, Q8 hybrid-greenlit small+reversible build; idea record
 * `docs/design/2026-07-21-moonshot-round2-divergent-slate.md` §2 Theme C, C1 — consensus 9/9/9, the
 * batch's sole unanimous exceptional).
 *
 * Eliminations in a staged competition (0006 staged-rounds evolution) currently reveal as bare,
 * deliberately INERT drop events — "bare eliminations for the narrator to improvise"
 * (`liveSeason.ts`'s `eliminationContent`). This module attaches a seeded, character-expressive
 * `failureStyle` FACT to each pre-rolled drop — HOW a houseguest loses becomes a stable, recurring comic
 * signature ("here he goes again") instead of a blank the narrator has to invent from nothing.
 *
 * PURE and Vault-free by construction: every input is either a byte-stable genesis `CHARACTER` facet
 * (archetype), an already-Vault-safe derived word (`moodWord`, which the rest of the engine already
 * treats as safe to voice), a public competition format, or a plain integer (a prior-wipeout count) —
 * no hidden state, no VaultStore import, no raw stat/number ever appears in the composed text. The
 * caller (`liveSeason.ts`) owns the ONE load-bearing discipline this module depends on: `rng` MUST be a
 * stream FORKED from the comp's beat rng AFTER the single up-front `resolveCompetition` roll that fixes
 * the crown + drop order — never the parent stream — so nothing here can perturb the outcome axis
 * (`tests/unit/stagedTrajectoryNeutral.test.ts` is the byte-identity guard on that discipline).
