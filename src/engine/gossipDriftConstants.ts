/**
 * Feature (issue #1397) — CHARACTER-MEDIATED gossip-drift tunables (the single-tunable-home pattern:
 * sibling of `GOSSIP`/`LEGEND` in `gossip.ts`, and of `CONFIDENCE`/`THREAD`/`DRIVE`/`TRIGGER`). One home
 * for every number the drift-mediation reads; no inline magic at the `gossip.ts` call sites (the B59 gate).
 *
 * The base gossip diffusion (0038 / audit SG-6) already DISTORTS a rumor's claimed NATURE as it passes
 * hop to hop — but personality-AGNOSTICALLY (a fixed 50/50 escalate-or-soften severity step, a fixed hedge
 * pool). This module makes that distortion CHARACTER-MEDIATED: the RETELLER's own PUBLIC voice (feature
 * 0084 `VoiceProfile` — register / rhythm / energy / directness / humor, all Vault-free public dials) biases
 * HOW the claim mutates as it passes through THIS mouth:
 *
 *   • a dramatic / high-energy voice AMPLIFIES — biasing the severity step UP the ladder (toward the
 *     alarming end) and embellishing the hedge;
 *   • a blunt / flat voice FLATTENS — biasing the step DOWN (toward the mild end) with a curt hedge;
 *   • a strategic / evasive / low-directness voice shades toward AMBIGUITY — a hedged, non-committal
 *     phrasing (the severity lean stays near the neutral middle).
 *
 * HARD constraints honored here (enforced by `gossip.ts diffuseGossip` + the drift tests):
 *   • PUBLIC personality ONLY — never soul / Vault / relationship-hidden state (mandates #2 / #3). Every
 *     input is a `VoiceProfile` DIAL STRING (the audited closed vocabulary — no digit, no hidden marker).
 *   • OPEN-SET only (ADR 0005) — this re-weights the CONTENT / phrasing of the propagated belief; it never
 *     touches the closed set (factId lineage, confidence / decay math, which edges move, or any seeded
 *     magnitude). No number ever crosses to the player.
 *   • CALIBRATION-NEUTRAL — voice re-weights ONLY the severity-step DIRECTION threshold + the hedge POOL,
 *     each an existing forked-rng draw whose COUNT and POSITION are unchanged; `baseTypeDriftProb` and
 *     `baseSubjectSwapProb` stay VOICE-INDEPENDENT so the subject-swap decision (hence the E44 receipt
 *     fold's parent-rng draw count) is byte-identical whether the layer is off or on. Absent voice ⇒ the
 *     BASE values below ⇒ byte-identical to the pre-feature agnostic drift.
