/**
 * Vendored HOMETOWN corpus (L28, 2026-06-19): a real Big Brother cast comes from ALL OVER — never
 * three houseguests from the player's hometown, never one region's accent on the whole house. Each
 * entry pairs a CITY with its REGION so the `CharacterFactory` can spread the cast geographically
 * (capping how many share a region) and so the stored hometown reads concrete and persists airtight
 * (the narrator voices THIS city, never an invented or drifting one).
 *
 * Composition: 130+ cities across the US census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) plus a
 * handful of international origins — the geographic variety a producer-filtered cast actually shows.
 * Raw material only: which city lands on which houseguest is the seed's draw, never a fixed pairing.
 * `region` is the spread key for the diversity cap; `city` is what the narrator speaks. A few cities
 * repeat across the corpus is fine — the engine caps PER REGION so no single area dominates a house.
