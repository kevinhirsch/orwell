/**
 * Feature 0110 — Vote deduction (process of elimination).
 *
 * Eviction votes are SECRET ballots (0047): the COUNT is public, the attribution is not. An evictee
 * cannot be handed the true tally — so they DEDUCE who moved against them from the public count, the
 * eligible voter pool, and their OWN reads (who they trusted "wouldn't", who they suspected). The
 * result is a BELIEF (0002) held with a confidence, and it CAN BE WRONG. The 0037/0014 jury grudge
 * folds on this belief (never on the true `votesToEvict`), which honors the secret ballot while keeping
 * jury management real:
 *   • a deducible defector earns the grudge;
 *   • an UNDEDUCIBLE secret vote earns none (secrecy honored);
 *   • a WRONG deduction misattributes it (dramatic irony).
 *
 * PURE + engine-only. No number, belief, or confidence ever crosses the wall (mandate #2/#3).
