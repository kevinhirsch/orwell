/**
 * Feature 0101 (#1401) — the AI SHOWRUNNER: the PURE "producer's notes" core. NO I/O, NO Vault handle,
 * NO rng. It is handed the ALREADY-READ, Vault-FREE signals for each SIMMERING hidden thread (tension /
 * staleness / current-board salience — the adapter fills these from the relationship model + the season
 * position) and returns a `ShowrunnerNote`: a shortlist of threads with a CLAMPED, boost-only `emphasis`
 * multiplier and a class/position-based `rationale`. Same signals ⇒ same note (a pure function of its
 * inputs; the thread id is the seed-stable tiebreaker) — determinism for free, so it can never perturb
 * the seeded competition/vote spine (§calibration).
 *
 * ADR 0005 — the note proposes SHAPE only. There is deliberately NO outcome field: an outcome directive
 * ("surface this", "evict", "protect the player", "winner") is INEXPRESSIBLE in this schema. The only
 * thing a note carries is a bounded `emphasis` multiplier over the EXISTING seeded 0060 surfacing
 * selection — the engine keeps every magnitude, eligibility rule, and hard cap. The Vault Wall is
 * preserved by construction: a signal is a NUMBER derived from the engine's own reads (never a premise),
 * and the `rationale` is a producer-language gloss keyed off the numeric signals (never a premise, never
 * a number) — so a note is safe to unseal in the 0048 retrospective as the season's production bible.
