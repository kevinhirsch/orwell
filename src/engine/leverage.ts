 * Features 0093 + 0099 — secrets as power. The PURE decision core (no I/O, no Vault handle): given
 * already-read, Vault-hidden signals (relationship edges + the secret's PUBLIC severity class + soul
 * state), it decides the bounded, seeded MAGNITUDE of using a held secret three ways — LEVERAGE on its
 * subject in a deal, EXPOSE it to the house, or TRADE it to a third-party recipient. Deception is
 * first-class: any use may be truthful or a BLUFF (a fabricated claim). The caller (the adapter) reads
 * the sealed state, validates the player owns the `factId`, and records the consequence; this module
 * only computes amounts. Seeded + deterministic (rng injected); pure ⇒ unit-testable in isolation.
 *
 * The anti-sycophancy spine (ADR 0005 / mandate #3): the model proposes only the SHAPE — which secret,
 * which target, the prose — and the ENGINE owns every magnitude here. No raw number ever crosses to the
 * player OR admin. The severity gloss reads ONLY the public `kind` of the secret, never its sealed text
 * (sibling to 0075's `teaseGloss`): no Vault content informs an amount — so a held secret can never be
 * *pumped* to force a yes or flatten a rival. The ceiling is real-but-recoverable, never deterministic.
