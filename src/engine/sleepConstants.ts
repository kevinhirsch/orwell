/**
 * 0066 — the single tunable home for the in-game-time / sleep economy (ADR 0006), the accepted 24-hour
 * model (#1125). One module per layer (the B59 convention — siblings: `trajectoryConstants`,
 * `juryHouseConstants`, `triggerConstants`): NO sleep/time magnitude is inlined at a call site, so the
 * whole economy retunes here without touching logic. Everything is ENGINE-ONLY and Vault-class — no
 * number here ever crosses to the player or admin (mandate #2); the player feels these only as later
 * behavior (a worse comp, a flatter late-night house, a crankier tired houseguest) + their own cue.
 *
 * THE 24-HOUR MODEL. A day is 24 hours, measured from the 8am forced wake:
 *   morning   [8,12)  · afternoon [12,16) · evening [16,20) · night [20,24) · late-night [24,32)
 * The clock runs `hourOfDay` ∈ [8, 32): 8 = the morning wake, 32 = the next 8am (a new day). It clamps
 * at the bitter end (never silently wraps) — a new day begins ONLY at the 8am forced wake (everyone up).
 *
 * SLEEP (symmetric, player + NPC): an 8-hour sleep need against the fixed 8am wake.
 *   • bed at midnight (h=24) → 8h → wake exactly at 8am → 0 debt.
 *   • bed AFTER midnight (h>24) → woken early at 8am → debt = h − 24 (hours of sleep lost).
 *   • bed BEFORE midnight (h<24) → 8h sleep lands BEFORE 8am → wake in the pre-dawn tail (h+8) → 0 debt
 *     + bonus awake time (the early-riser window). Two distinct late-night windows: post-midnight owls
 *     (costly) vs pre-dawn larks (free).
 * Debt is GRADED → a hidden, bounded comp penalty + (ext2) next-day social fatigue + (ext3) the
 * compounding multi-night meter. No rng anywhere — bedtimes are DERIVED, the meter is a pure EMA — so
 * with every flag ON the seeded competition/vote/jury stream is never re-phased (zero extra draws); and
 * dormant off the opt-in clock ⇒ byte-identical to the calibration spine.
