/**
 * In-game time of day + the nightly sleep economy (ADR 0006), the accepted 24-HOUR model (#1125). A PURE
 * domain helper: the five public day-phases as HOUR BANDS, how the clock advances by PLAY (never a
 * wall-clock), each houseguest's character-driven bedtime HOUR, the BIDIRECTIONAL awake set (the house
 * thins toward midnight then refills toward the 8am wake), the player's own qualitative rest read, and the
 * hidden GRADED sleep DEBT the competition fold consumes. No I/O and — critically — no shared-stream
 * randomness: a bedtime is DERIVED deterministically from a houseguest's STATIC aptitudes (CHARACTER,
 * never the soul/Vault), so the seeded calibration spine (juryReach / UAT golden streams) stays
 * byte-identical and a bedtime is stable for the whole season (it is who they are, not a roll).
 *
 * THE DAY (hours-of-day, from the 8am forced wake):
 *   morning [8,12) · afternoon [12,16) · evening [16,20) · night [20,24) · late-night [24,32)
 * The clock runs `hourOfDay` ∈ [8, 32) and CLAMPS at the bitter end — it never silently wraps; a new day
 * begins ONLY at the 8am forced wake (everyone up). The player is never auto-slept (Principle 6); they
 * choose when to turn in. The bound on "functionally infinite" scheming is diegetic (Principle 3): as the
 * night runs past midnight, NPCs turn in and the awake set thins; then pre-dawn larks wake and it refills.
