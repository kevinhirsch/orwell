/**
 * Feature 0100 — the JURY HOUSE: a sequestered SECOND society of the last-nine evictees who keep
 * living (hidden, NPC↔NPC) and gossip about the player and each other between turns, so the
 * accumulated treatment a finalist carried into the jury is HARDENED or SOFTENED by what the room
 * does with it before the vote. This module is PURE in the 0075/0038 sense — no Vault handle, no
 * direct adapter import; it is handed the already-read signals (juror set, directed edges, recorded
 * manner) plus the `EventStore`/`KnowledgeService`/dedicated `rng` it records onto, and returns the
 * BOUNDED per-(juror, finalist) grudge adjustment the caller accumulates into the persisted jury read.
 *
 * The Vault Wall holds by construction (mandate #2): the jurors form the entire society + gossip
 * graph (the PLAYER is never a node), the recorded scenes are hidden (witness set = the two jurors,
 * never the player — the player is not in the jury house), and the grievance rumor names the player
 * only as a SUBJECT of its content. No jury-house pathway can terminate at the player — there is no
 * edge to the player to travel — so the player learns nothing of it until the finale, and even then
 * only through a juror's (hidden-state-driven) bearing and the vote that breaks.
 *
 * Calibration (the hard requirement): the caller drives this on a DEDICATED, isolated rng (the
 * `campaignTick` pattern) and gates the whole call behind `ORWELL_JURY_HOUSE`. The grievance
 * diffusion takes NO relationship fold (`diffuseGossip` without `rel`/`subjects`, like
 * `whisperConspicuousPairings`) — it moves no live edge and the grudge is folded into a SEPARATE,
 * saturated map the finale reads alongside the recorded manner — so with the flag off NOTHING runs
 * (zero draws, no fold ⇒ the seeded `juryReach`/UAT spine is byte-identical), and even with it on the
 * main house's seeded competition/vote stream is untouched (only the hidden finale lean changes).
