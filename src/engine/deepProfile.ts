/**
 * Feature 0058 — deep character profiles ("born deep, persist, play out").
 *
 * THIS module: the DETERMINISTIC, seeded floor for the §3-depth profile, split across the Vault Wall —
 * the offline fallback the engine validates LLM output against, and the live profile source when no
 * authoring model is wired. From each houseguest's seed-stable Character it produces TWO things:
 *
 *   1. PUBLIC facets (`PublicDepth`) — a real multi-sentence `biography` (not a one-liner) + a
 *      STRUCTURED `physicalCharacteristics` facet (the single source of truth for BOTH the portrait
 *      prompt AND the text narration, L29/L23). These ride on the public, byte-stable `Character` and
 *      DO cross to the player.
 *
 *   2. HIDDEN profile (`DeepProfile`) — 2–3 secrets, the TRUE strategic goals, the named weakness /
 *      blind spot, and the Day-1 perception-of-the-player read. ENGINE-ONLY: it is sealed into the
 *      Vault and NEVER appears on any outward projection (the §8 Vault-Wall non-negotiable). It is a
 *      richer, structured sibling of the older `hiddenElements` (B50) — same discipline, more depth.
 *
 * Phase 2 is LIVE (no longer deferred): the LLM authors these (endless variety) and writes them BACK
 * through `GameSession.recordCastProfile` — the engine then validates / repairs / splits / seals (the
 * 0051 portrait-prompt handshake mirror, ledger L28b). The portrait consumption (L29 — the structured
 * physical facet feeds `castPortraitPrompts`), the premiere voicing (L31 — the public biography is
 * voiced through the `premiere` moment prompt), and the FULL thread trigger/resolution scheduler
 * (feature 0060 — `GameSessionAdapter.scheduleStoryThreads`, wired into the off-screen tick) are all
 * wired. This module remains the deterministic floor: it seeds, seals, persists, and the live scheduler
 * walks the threads dormant→active→surfaced→resolved→expired.
 *
 * Determinism: every generator is driven by a SIDE rng hashed off the houseguest's name + seed, so it
 * never perturbs the main house stream (stats/names stay byte-stable, 0007) and the same seed yields
 * the same depth regardless of who the player is (L28 non-mirroring).
 *
 * No-leak discipline (CRITICAL): no PUBLIC facet string may serialize a banned stat KEY substring
 * ("physical"/"mental"/"social") or a bare float — the Vault scans hunt for `"physical":`-style keys
 * and floats. The public pools below are plain English with none of that vocabulary.

 *     and the cast-wide `caps` fill are BYTE-IDENTICAL to the old shared-pool floor. The move-in edges,
 *     and every downstream comp/vote/jury outcome, are therefore unchanged by this PR.
 *   • `narrativeRng` (the dedicated NARRATIVE stream): the conditioned, coherent hidden text — fully
 *     isolated, so however many draws the conditioning makes it CANNOT perturb the outcome stream.
 * Net effect: identical OUTCOMES to the old floor, with coherent character-conditioned hidden TEXT. The

 * vocation, two NPCs almost never share a verbatim premise (no shared-pool collision is even possible).
 *
 * Back-compat: with NO `character`, it falls to the legacy shared-pool draw (the bare-rng generators the
 * scheduler/standalone tests still exercise). When `caps` is supplied that legacy path honors the L41
 * spread caps; the conditioned path needs no secret/goal/weakness caps (the conditioning makes verbatim
 * collisions vanishingly rare) but still caps the small Day-1 PERCEPTION pool through `caps.perceptionUses`.
 *
 * RNG-ISOLATION (#392): on the conditioned path the OUTCOME-relevant `dayOnePerception` is still drawn
 * off `rng` byte-identically to the legacy floor (so the move-in NPC→player edge is unchanged), while the
 * narrative TEXT is composed off a DEDICATED sub-stream — derived from `narrativeSeed` when the caller
 * supplies a per-NPC key (the cast-wide/live path), else forked off the facets so a standalone call stays
 * deterministic. See {@link generateConditionedDeepProfile}.
