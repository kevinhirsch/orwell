 * Feature T0-3 (issue #1778, D1 2026-07-21 owner ruling) — the ADR 0003 amendment: closed-set
 * ceremony OUTCOMES stop being something the narration model reports and become something the
 * engine BROADCASTS. This module is the pure, Vault-free derivation: given a just-committed
 * weekly-loop `BeatEvent` and the live season state immediately after it committed, decide which
 * (if any) `BeatAnnouncement` facts that beat represents.
 *
 * Scope (weekly loop, HOH → eviction — the T0-3 DoD bar): HOH winner, nominations, veto winner,
 * the veto decision, the replacement nominee, the anonymized eviction ballot sequence (E12), and
 * the eviction result (including the Final-3 `final-eviction` variant). Finale/twist/battle-back
 * announcements are an explicit, scoped-out follow-up (see the PR body) — every other beat maps
 * to zero announcements here, which is the correct, inert default (nothing is dropped; it is
 * simply not yet built).
 *
 * STRUCTURALLY Vault-free: this file reads only `BeatEvent` (already player-witnessed, EVT-1) and
 * the handful of `LiveSeasonState` fields that are ALSO exposed, verbatim, through
 * `PublicGameStatus`/`GameStateView.ceremony`/`EvictionView` (`hoh`, `nominees`, `vetoHolder`,
 * `vetoUsed`, `saved`, `replacement`, `eviction.{nominees,voteOf}`) — never a hidden/Vault field —
 * and it imports nothing from `VaultStore`/`VectorIndex`, so the dependency-cruiser Vault-Wall gate
 * covers it for free, same as every other file under `src/engine`.
