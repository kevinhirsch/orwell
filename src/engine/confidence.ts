/**
 * Feature 0075 — trust-gated confidences (a houseguest opens up to you). The PURE decision core: given
 * already-read, Vault-hidden signals (relationship edges + the goodwill ledger + the sealed secret), it
 * decides WHETHER a houseguest confides, WHICH tier (how much), and whether it is TRUE or a LIE — and
 * produces the text the model is handed to voice. No I/O, no Vault handle: the caller (the adapter) reads
 * the sealed state and records the disclosure via `surfaceInformationTo` (0002). Seeded + deterministic.
 *
 * The Vault Wall is preserved structurally (not by wording): the ENGINE decides + records every
 * disclosure (the model never selects/invents a secret); a `tease`/`partial` tier never returns the full
 * premise; and a LIE is engine-authored from the PUBLIC archetype, so no real secret of anyone crosses.
