/**
 * Feature 0104 — the single tunable home for season-over-season NOTORIETY (a reputation that
 * precedes the returning player into a new cast). The sibling-constants pattern
 * (`relationshipConstants` / `seededRelationshipConstants` / `threadConstants` / `juryConstants`):
 * every magnitude the derivation + the day-one bias read lives HERE, never inlined at a call site
 * (the B59 grep gate covers it), all God-Mode-knobbable later (0016 count-only).
 *
 * CALIBRATION (sacred — mandates #3 + #4). Notoriety is OPT-IN and DIEGETIC (R4): a summary is
 * derived + folded ONLY when the player chooses to return as the SAME character (the existing 0056
 * `keepCharacter` door). A NEW character / no prior season / `weight = 0` ⇒ NO summary, NO bias, so
 * `seedFirstImpressions` is BYTE-IDENTICAL and the seeded juryReach / gradient / UAT spine is unmoved
 * (`tests/unit/notorietyOutcomeNeutral.test.ts` is the neutrality gate). The bias is a BOUNDED, signed
 * DIRECTION inside the existing `MOVE_IN.spread` scatter envelope — it tilts the new cast's day-one
 * NPC→player move-in distribution, it NEVER sets a raw number, never seeds the player's own edges, and
 * NEVER touches a competition / vote / jury roll. The engine still owns every outcome magnitude (R2).
