// house lives between the player's own turns (one bounded off-screen tick per turn) and does NOT
// exist while the player is away. The wall-clock watcher (0031/0035) is an opt-in operator knob

// space. Any warm-up failure (no model cache + no network, missing native runtime) falls

// the game never breaks, and the next restart may upgrade again. Unset/anything-else keeps
