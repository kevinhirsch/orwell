// ── the play-clock (real-time purge 2026-07-10, PO ruling) ──────────────────────────

// The orchestrator's per-turn tick seeds derived rng streams and recency windows with
// `clock.now()` (`confessional-recent/-phrasing:${clockNow}`, `orch:day:${clockNow}` ids). This is
// a pure `LogicalClock`: it starts at a FIXED epoch and advances ONLY on committed mutations (one
// in-house minute per commit) — so nothing in the game reads wall time, the house lives only on the
// player's play-clock, and identical commit sequences ⇒ identical clock sequences ⇒ identical tick
// behavior at any pacing. Reads never advance it (read counts are wall-clock-paced — the driver's
// quiesce polls — and must stay clock-neutral). This makes 0108's golden record/replay deterministic
// for free, and — the PO ruling — guarantees no version can ever run the house in real time: the old
// wall-clock `SystemClock` + background `GameWatcher` were DELETED, not disabled.
