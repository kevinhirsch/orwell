  // invariant with ceremony beats alone and none of this module's "the house lives between
  // ceremonies" texture. Gate on "any real tick, not an audit dry run" instead — `defaultApply` is

  // texture — it records one player-witnessed house-event but consumes ZERO draws from the shared

  // mid-day side-conversation as a new day event. So we dedupe on the in-game DAY: the ambient headline
  // is stamped `Week W[, day D]:` by `nextHouseEvent`, and we record at most one per distinct stamp —
  // it fires when the player first arrives at a new (week, day) and then stays quiet until the day turns
