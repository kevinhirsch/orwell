        Slash-command / setup replies are persisted to history so they render
        in the transcript, but they are UI chatter (e.g. ``/setup ...`` and its
        status lines) the user never meant as conversation. They carry
        ``metadata.source == "slash"``; exclude them here so they never reach
        the model. Display/history-load paths use the raw ``history`` and are
        unaffected.

        ``exclude_phases`` is the Vault-Wall scope for the in-game narrator
        (casting-leak fix). The pre-game casting interview (0050) is an OOC,
        producer-level channel — like the Diary Room, it has NO in-game pathway
        to any NPC's knowledge. Those turns are persisted with
        ``metadata.phase == "casting"`` (so the player still SEES them in
        scrollback — one continuous conversation), but once a season is live the
        in-game narration context EXCLUDES them so the model cannot leak the
        player's private casting strategy/OOC reads to the houseguests. The model
        cannot leak what it never receives. Pass ``{"casting"}`` on a live-game
        turn; display/history paths use raw ``history`` and are unaffected.

        ``exclude_pre_game`` (#530 — STRUCTURAL casting-leak guard) makes the
        exclusion independent of every casting turn being individually stamped.
        The per-message ``phase == "casting"`` stamp can MISS (the finalize
        boundary computes ``game_active`` once at turn-start; a turn persisted
        without the stamp would otherwise leak). When the season is live, live
        play turns are stamped ``phase == "game"`` — the season-start boundary.
        With ``exclude_pre_game=True`` we drop EVERY turn before the first
        ``"game"``-stamped turn (the boundary, by sequence) that is not itself a
        live turn — so any UNSTAMPED pre-game turn is treated as casting and
        excluded structurally, even if its ``"casting"`` stamp was never written.
