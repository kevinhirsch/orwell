"""Issue #1660 — cast-identity coherence: the FE belt that stops deep-authoring from committing a
houseguest whose photo contradicts their narration.

Pins the three tractable fixes for the 2026-07-16 debug bundle (5 gender-flipped houseguests, a
retired-principal 22-year-old):

  * F2 — the author-time WRITE-BACK coherence lint (this PR): an authored profile whose
    self-referential prose contradicts the houseguest's PINNED identity is refused (the contradicting
    field is dropped to the coherent seeded floor) BEFORE `recordCastProfile`, and a RED-eligible
    `identity-incoherence` health event is recorded (#1599). A coherent dossier is a byte-identical no-op.
  * F3 — reasoning-channel salvage (landed #1662, pinned here): when the visible body is empty but the
    model MISROUTED the JSON answer into the reasoning channel, the paid-for content is USED, not
    discarded, and a RED reasoning-channel-misroute event is recorded.
  * F4 — genesis token budget (landed #1662, pinned here): the full-cast genesis sketch output floor
    clears the ~4400-token skeleton with headroom, so the whole-cast skeleton is never chopped at the
    one-NPC-sized 3000 cap (`finish_reason=length` → committed nothing).

Roles only — every probe string is generic (no houseguest names).
