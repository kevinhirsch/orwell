"""Reasoning persistence + cross-session sync (reasoning-leak / desync fix).

Two side-by-side browser sessions were a "hot mess": the model's private reasoning leaked
raw into the public bubble and was only re-sorted into the collapsed "Thinking" accordion
client-side, in-memory — so the fix never survived a reload and never reached a second tab.

Root cause (two halves):

  C. PERSISTENCE — clean-channel reasoning (DeepSeek/vLLM `{delta, thinking:true}` deltas)
     was streamed to the client but DROPPED before persistence: chat_routes accumulated only
     non-thinking deltas into `full_response`, so `save_assistant_response` never saw the
     reasoning and `metadata.thinking` was never set. On reload / in a second tab the
     accordion vanished (or the reasoning was re-guessed differently). Fix: accumulate a
     parallel `full_reasoning` and thread it into the save so it lands in `metadata.thinking`.

  D. RENDER UNIFICATION — the cross-device re-attach path (`resumeStream`) ignored the
     `thinking:true` flag entirely and rendered every delta raw through `mdToHtml`, so an
     observer tab dumped reasoning straight into the bubble. Fix: split reasoning from reply
     and render through the SAME `processWithThinking` path the primary stream + history use,
     with reasoning wrapped in a CLOSED <think> block so it can only ever land in the accordion.

These are source-level assertions (the route/stream files boot the whole app or are vanilla JS
with no JS test runner) plus an import-guarded functional check of the pure persistence helper.
