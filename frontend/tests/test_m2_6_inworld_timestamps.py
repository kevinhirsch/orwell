"""M2-6 (audit B5) — in-world timestamps on transcript beats.

A live-game beat's transcript stamp should read the GAME MOMENT ("Week 1 · Eviction night ·
Late night"), with the real wall clock demoted to hover/metadata (the `title`). Pre-game
(casting) keeps a NEUTRAL wall-clock stamp — the producer interview is out-of-fiction and must
not be dated by the game clock. No engine change: the moment is formatted from the Vault-free
public status the FE already fetches (week / phase / time-of-day on `GameStateView`).

This gate pins BOTH halves of the render contract:
  • server — `_format_game_moment` turns the public status into the moment string (None pre-game),
    `apply_game_framing` stashes it, and the persist site stamps it into assistant-message metadata
    ONLY on a game-active turn (via `game_moment=` on `save_assistant_response`) + rides it on the
    `message_saved` event for the live/mirror bubble;
  • client — `chatRenderer.roleTimestamp(when, moment)` prefers the moment as the primary stamp and
    demotes the wall clock to the `title`; the AI-header call sites pass `metadata.game_moment`.
