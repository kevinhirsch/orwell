"""NARR-1 (#620): the gateway narration call uses the REAL `_resolve_llm_fn` contract.

The old `gateway/handler.py` imported `_resolve_llm_fn` from `src.agent_loop` (where it does NOT
exist — it lives in `src.orwell_cast_authoring`), so the import raised every turn and the gateway
ALWAYS returned the "not configured" placeholder, never narrating. It also called the resolver as a
sync fn with `system=`/`stream=` kwargs, but the real resolver is an async `_resolve_llm_fn(owner)`
returning an `LlmFn` that takes a `messages: list[dict]` and returns a string.

These tests pin the corrected wiring: a configured model narrates; no model ⇒ the placeholder.
