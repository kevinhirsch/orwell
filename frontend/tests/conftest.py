"""Test setup for the app-admin feature (0029).

The vendored front-end's package `core/__init__.py` eagerly boots the whole app
(llm_core, the database, cryptography), which can't import in a bare test env. The
app-admin logic, though, lives entirely in the self-contained `core.auth` and
`core.middleware` modules. We load just those by stubbing the `core` package so its
heavy `__init__` never runs.

# source calls `sync_playwright` is the `browser` lane. Everything else is xdist-safe (verified: the only
# real fixed-port server binds in the whole suite live in `sync_playwright` files; every other port
# reference is a monkeypatched stub string). Select with `-m browser` / `-m "not browser"`.

# `orwell_cast_authoring` keeps the per-season attempt/give-up ledger in module globals
# (`_attempt_ledger` / `_gaveup_logged`). Without a per-test reset it accumulates across tests
# AND across files — a burst test that drives an NPC to the give-up cap leaks that give-up into a
# later completeness/concurrency assertion, so co-run ORDER (and xdist worker distribution) decides
# pass/fail. Reset it before every test that already imported the module (cheap: no-op when it isn't
# loaded, so unrelated tests pay nothing).
# ── shared async-test helper ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Four cast-authoring test files each defined the same helper inline. Hoisted here so
# there is a single canonical copy: one call per test, no shared loop state. The helper
# creates a pristine loop, runs the coroutine, closes the loop, then installs a fresh
# OPEN loop so subsequent `asyncio.get_event_loop()` consumers never meet a closed loop
# (a bare `asyncio.run()` would leave the main-thread loop closed, breaking later tests).
