"""ADR 0009 NPC auto-move belt: a room a HOUSEGUEST walks to (in the narration) but the model never
moveHouseguest's is folded into the engine's OPEN occupancy by the FE.

The mirror of L21/L24 (the player belt) for the other 15 people. The model reliably UNDER-calls
moveHouseguest: it narrates "Marcus heads to the kitchen" but never moves the engine — so next turn the
whereabouts gadget snaps Marcus back to his seeded room (the chat↔board location desync). The FE now
back-fills the move via a constrained extraction: only a houseguest the narration clearly walked to a
room is relayed, the ENGINE decides legality (it refuses the player / a non-existent houseguest / the
diary room / an unwalkable room and no-ops a same-room move), and we count only the moves the engine
actually applied. Vault-free (whereabouts is a Vault-free projection).

SYNC tests only (pytest-asyncio AUTO mode) — drive coroutines via run_until_complete, never asyncio.run().
