"""The SOCIAL RUNWAY — the "never fast-forward through ceremonies" fix.

Owner playtest verdict (the defect this proves fixed): "It should never fast forward in the game…
it skips all of the social narrative gameplay and advances straight to nominations… There is zero
social opportunity. This is a critical failure."

Root cause: the C-02 pre-resolve advanced ONE engine beat per turn whenever no player decision was
pending, so for a spectator player the chain HOH → noms → veto → eviction marched with no social
turns between ceremonies. The fix holds a SOCIAL RUNWAY of player turns after each ceremony lands
the player in a new spectator beat — overriding the moment to the engine's own `social` beat and
NOT advancing — until the runway is spent (or the player asks to move on). Pacing only: the engine
still decides every outcome; we never invent content, we just stop skipping the player's turns.
