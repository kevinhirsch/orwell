"""Lane G22 — the Cast window renders portraits PROGRESSIVELY (stream-feel).

Portrait generation (0051) is a server-side background job: faces land one by
one over several seconds. Two defects made the panel feel dead, both pinned
shut here:

  1. a fixed 30s poll — a finished portrait could sit unseen for up to half a
     minute, and the whole set then popped in at once on the next tick;
  2. render() wiped the grid and rebuilt EVERY card each poll — already-loaded
     <img> nodes re-mounted (flicker), with no per-face arrival.

The G22 shape (orwellCast.js only):

  * adaptive cadence — FAST_POLL_MS while the roster reports a run in flight
    (imagesAvailable with portraitsPresent < portraitsTotal), the idle POLL_MS
    once complete or providerless; ONE self-rescheduling setTimeout, cleared
    before every re-arm, still gated on the panel being open + tab visible;
  * keyed incremental render — a Map of roster id → card, upserted in place;
    an <img> src is assigned only on a real transition (never re-assigned the
    same url), vanished ids drop, and ordering MOVES live nodes (no re-mount);
  * a gentle fade-in on a just-landed face, disabled under
    prefers-reduced-motion.

Pins are CODE identifiers (the suite convention — see test_h2b's helpers),
never comment prose, so a comment edit can't trip them. Roles only (player /
NPC / houseguest) — no names.
