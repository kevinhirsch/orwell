"""M2-5 (audit B4/B7) — narrator identity + production-slate beat styling.

Owner pick (2026-07-08): the transcript author is the show's **production voice** — never the
model name. "Orwell" stays product chrome (wordmark, tab, admin).

#1626 increment 2 RELAXED the original "Production is phase-invariant" rule to
**producer-name-invariance**: the byline DEFAULTS to "Production" (`GAME_NARRATOR`, the single
registry constant + the parked P-1 rebrand's one line) and, once the engine resolves the season's
seeded Vault-free producer name, the byline reflects THAT producer — dynamic, but STABLE PER SEASON
(the same producer every phase/turn, not per-phase). Every game-build author site reads the dynamic
`gameNarrator()` getter (window.ORWELL_GAME_NARRATOR, fail-open to "Production"), the stream hands the
name to the client via the `orwell_narrator` event, and the monogram seeds off the same name.

Beats still render as production slates in the game build: no lowercase "done" debug tail (failures
stay literal — operator truth), slate type on the label, one aligned rail.
