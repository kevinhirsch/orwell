"""#985 P2-A — "send-while-streaming is silently dropped" → a SEND QUEUE / OUTBOX.

Root cause (verified by trace, frontend/static/js/chat.js handleChatSubmit):
  A Send made WHILE a turn is streaming entered with `isStreaming === true` and fell into the STOP
  branch — which aborts the in-flight reply and `return`s BEFORE the new composer text is ever read or
  its optimistic bubble painted. So a message sent mid-stream was silently discarded.

The fix (FE-only, chat.js — the owner explicitly chose "Queue it"):
  - A Send with NON-EMPTY composer text while streaming ENQUEUES the message into an in-memory FIFO
    `_sendOutbox` (`_enqueueSend`), paints its optimistic bubble NOW (pending shape: clientMsgId, no
    dbId/seq → floats to the tail per #992), and CLEARS the composer — it does NOT Stop.
  - The outbox flushes IN ORDER once the current turn settles (`_flushSendOutbox`, called from the
    stream-end finally): one in flight at a time, each item dispatched as a headless send that re-uses
    its already-painted bubble + its clientMsgId (idempotent / at-most-once; the existing
    optimistic-adopt path reconciles by clientMsgId, so flushes are clean across windows).
  - STOP is reserved for the explicit Stop button / an EMPTY composer — the two actions are no longer
    collapsed onto one silent action.

Like #836 / #985-P2-B this is an LLM-stub-blind path, so the runtime gates drive the REAL chat.js
helpers in headless chromium. They FAIL on pre-fix main (no queue → the mid-stream message is dropped)
and PASS after.
