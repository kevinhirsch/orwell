"""BL-004 (2026-07-16 full-playtest audit) — the correction-queue CAPACITY + voiced-correction gate.

The audited premiere session's single-slot ``_DESYNC_REGROUND`` correction store dropped **17 of 24**
queued prose corrections: a fresh closed-set re-ground OVERWROTE an unconsumed one, and a second
correction queued while one was "in flight" was silently DEFERRED. Worse, even the correction that DID
survive was applied internally but there was no signal it was ever VOICED back to the player.

This pins the fix:
  * ``_DESYNC_REGROUND[key]`` is a BOUNDED, ``\\n\\n``-joined FIFO of closed-set corrections — enqueue
    APPENDS a distinct correction (never clobbers a prior distinct one), an EXACT repeat is de-duped,
    and a hard cap ``log()``s the dropped oldest segment (no silent truncation, per CLAUDE.md);
  * a DRAINED correction (consumed into the next framed prompt) records a SUCCESS-GATED belt fire
    (``desync-reground-voiced``) so voiced-vs-merely-queued is measurable (belt-telemetry contract:
    a fire means an APPLIED correction, never a mere selection).

Closed-set ONLY (ADR 0005) — every correction is a board/state re-ground, never creative prose; the
expressive-non-collapse gate stays the proof of that and is untouched here. Roles only — no names.
