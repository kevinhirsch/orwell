"""Lane H2+H3 — settings fixes (2026-06-11).

H2 — every "default <X> model" select mirrors the Default Chat Model card.
The image-generation select (and the other flat model selects) used to be fed
from a keyword include-list over /api/models plus a short HARDCODED fallback
list ("dall-e-3 (not detected)" …) — a few options that "don't make sense".
Now every default-model select draws from the ONE shared pool the chat card
offers (`_fetchModelEndpoints()` → `_availableModelIds()`): the models of
every enabled endpoint, with unavailable/offline ones excluded — data-driven,
no hardcoded model names, current selection preserved when still available.

H3 — the Settings → Appearance "Theme" card is gone. The theme picker already
has a standing home in the sidebar's bottom cluster (#tool-theme-btn), so the
redundant launcher card (and its dead JS wiring) was removed; the rest of the
appearance panel (Sidebar visibility toggles, Chat Area, …) stays intact, and
the browser smoke drives the picker via the sidebar entry instead.

Source pins are JS/HTML-as-text (the suite's convention); the runtime check
boots the real app, opens settings in headless chromium, and proves the image
select's options are a subset of the chat select's options. The runtime check
skips when chromium isn't available (CI's pytest step runs before playwright
installs; the browser-smoke step still gates the same surface there).
