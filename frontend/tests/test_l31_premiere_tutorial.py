"""L31 (FE half) — the premiere is a light, one-time, dismissible tutorial.

The engine drives the structured premiere (introductions round + gentler first-week cadence);
this is the FE framing: a quiet card shown during the engine's "premiere" moment (move-in, before
the meet-everyone gate lets the first HOH begin) that sets the weekly-rhythm expectation so a
brand-new player never has to prompt for it. It retires the instant that gate completes — NOT at
the week-2 boundary, since week 1 spans the whole HOH/noms/veto/eviction chain. It never replaces
the chat.

Source-pinned (the FE pytest lane has no DOM runtime; browser-smoke covers the live DOM). We pin
the gates (game-build, per-user dismiss, premiere-week), the module load, and the theme-token CSS.
