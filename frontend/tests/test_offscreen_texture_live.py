"""Feature 0070 (FE lane) — the LIVE wiring: an advance must actually fire the off-screen
texture enrichment, and the enrichment must actually reach the engine write-back.

The engine seam (recordOffscreenSceneTexture / getOffscreenSceneSkeletons) is proven by the TS
boundary test (tests/unit/offscreenTextureBoundary.test.ts). What that test CANNOT see is whether
the FE ever CALLS it — exactly the silent-no-op failure mode CLAUDE.md warns about for FE-driven
write-backs. These tests pin the FE half: the driver resolves its deps the same proven way the
other write-backs do, the write-back fires with voiced prose, it is content-only and fail-soft,
and `do_advance_game` kicks it off.

Roles only — no names (CLAUDE.md testing rule). Flavor only — nothing here touches a game outcome.
