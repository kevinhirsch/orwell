"""Issue #1412 (this half) — the mutating-tool manifest drift guard.

chat.js's tool-result seam used to carry a HAND-CODED array of "which tools fire a
HUD refresh (orwell:gamechanged)". A newly-wired mutating tool could silently leave
that array stale, so the status HUD lagged a whole poll period after that tool ran.

The fix (this half): a shared manifest `ORWELL_MUTATING_TOOLS` in platform.js —
DERIVED from the engine tool registry (`src/surfaces/tools/registry.ts`) and PINNED
to it by THIS test. chat.js then consumes `window.orwellIsMutatingTool(name)` (the
OTHER half of #1412) in place of its inline array; `test_g15_gamechanged.py` keeps
the single-`orwell:gamechanged`-dispatcher invariant.

The "by construction" guarantee: registry.ts has NO `mutating` flag, so the split
between HUD-mutating tools and pure reads / non-HUD write-backs is the one irreducible
human judgment — pinned here as READ_ONLY_TOOLS. EVERY other PLAYER_TOOL is treated as
mutating and MUST appear in the manifest. So ANY new registry tool trips this test
until it is classified: add it to ORWELL_MUTATING_TOOLS if its success moves the HUD,
else to READ_ONLY_TOOLS below. A new *mutating* tool therefore cannot ship without the
manifest being updated — and the HUD stays fresh by construction, not by hope.
