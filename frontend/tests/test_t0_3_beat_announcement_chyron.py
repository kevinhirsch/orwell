"""T0-3 (issue #1778, D1 2026-07-21 owner ruling) — the FE half of the BeatAnnouncement chyron.

ADR 0003 amendment: every committed closed-set ceremony fact is emitted by the engine as a
Vault-free `BeatAnnouncementView` (src/ports/GameSession.ts) on the SAME `advanceGame`/
`submitDecision` tool result the g15 seam already reads. This file pins:

  (1) the wire: chat.js dispatches a NEW `orwell:announcements` event carrying that SAME tool
      result's `announcements`, from the SAME branch that already dispatches `orwell:pending` —
      no new poll, no new transport (F5 two-window parity is inherited via the existing SSE mirror);
  (2) orwellDecision.js extends the shipped decision-card kit with a chyron renderer that listens
      for that event, dedups by announcement id (F4: exactly once, reload-resilient via a DOM
      `data-chyron-id` check), and stages multiple announcements card-by-card;
  (3) it never invents a second `orwell:gamechanged` dispatcher (g15's own hard rule stays intact
      — this file adds a belt-and-suspenders direct check alongside `test_g15_gamechanged.py`'s
      scoped regex);
  (4) a REAL browser behavioral test (`test_chyron_renders_and_dedups_in_a_real_browser`) proves the
      renderer actually paints the DOM and dedups, not just that the source strings exist.

Source-pinned checks (no DOM runtime needed) mirror this codebase's established convention for JS
wiring (see test_c20_decision_guardrail.py, test_j4_decision_card_a11y.py).
