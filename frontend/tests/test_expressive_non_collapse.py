"""The EXPRESSIVE-NON-COLLAPSE gate (ADR 0005 — split authority by openness, testability §5).

ADR 0005 splits authority by *openness*, not by *layer*: the CLOSED set (competition outcomes,
who is HOH / nominated / evicted, vote tallies, win conditions) is the engine's to dictate; the
OPEN set (the entire "neverending lexical book" of social and creative play) is the engine's to
RECORD faithfully and NEVER to normalize. Principle #1 is a hard constraint:

    "No sync mechanism may resolve an ambiguity by collapsing the open set onto the closed set."

The front-end's desync guard (`_narration_claims_outcome` in routes/chat_helpers.py) is one such
sync mechanism. Its jurisdiction is *hard factual (closed-set) board claims only* — a phantom
eviction, an early winner, a mis-narrated finale tally, an unchanged HOH. It must NEVER rail-back
a creative/social thread merely because the thread is novel and "uncoded." This file pins that
scoping as a permanent regression gate (the FE-side half of ADR 0005's testability section,
mirroring the engine-side Vitest), so a future sync patch that starts flattening play makes CI
say so.

Roles, not names: the PURPOSE of each case is described by ROLE (the player, a houseguest, the
HOH, the evicted houseguest, a juror). Throwaway proper nouns appear only INSIDE narration
strings to exercise the regexes realistically — exactly as the sibling
test_beat_signature_checkpoint.py does — and never carry test intent.

Fail-open + self-contained, matching the sibling test's conventions
