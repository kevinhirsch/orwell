"""#1659 R4 — Escalation that actually escalates (bundle failure seam 4).

The live-bundle audit (issue #1659) found the advance-stall family *diagnosed* a wedged season
but never ESCALATED: "13 advance-stall-family flags -> beltTotals['advance-stall-nudge'] = 1; the
L39b forced-advanceGame rung never fired". Root cause for the force never firing: the CONSECUTIVE
ladder (`_ADVANCE_STALL_LEVEL`) is popped clean every time the FE force-commits a beat for the
model, so a model that CHRONICALLY under-calls advanceGame is handed a fresh gentle ladder at each
new beat and the force keeps restarting from zero.

R4 (this slice) adds a SESSION-cumulative stall-flag tally (`_ADVANCE_STALL_FLAGS`) that survives
those FE cover-ups and arms the SAME L39b force once N flags accrue since the model last progressed
on its own — so the escalation actually escalates. It also pins that the markHouseguestMet belt and
the forced-tool rung reach `get_belt_totals` ONLY as APPLIED / OBSERVED fires (the success-gated
telemetry contract in `test_belt_telemetry.py`, which this file must not weaken).

Scope: FE agent-loop + belt telemetry ONLY. No engine / prompt / tool-schema / golden touch. The
error-correct-the-omission ruling holds — the belt only guarantees the SKIPPED advanceGame happens
(a closed-set progression the engine dictates); it never authors content and never forces
submitDecision, and the force stays gated on a lull + the beat-moved re-read guard.

Style: source pins over `agent_loop.py` (the escalation runs against the real engine only in the
live play-through harness) + ledger-behavioral checks over `orwell_sync_ledger`.
