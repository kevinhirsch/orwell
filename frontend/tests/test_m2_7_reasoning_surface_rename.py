"""M2-7 — the reasoning-surface diegetic rename.

The beat-chip half shipped earlier ("Production notes" in orwellToolBeats.js). This closes the
reconcile gap: the live/reload reasoning ACCORDION label and the Settings toggle copy still read
the debug wording ("View thinking process" / "Show <think> collapsible bars"). In the GAME BUILD
they now read as the show's "Production notes" family — matching the beat-chip register. The full
inherited workspace (ORWELL_GAME_BUILD=0 → the operator/dev surface) KEEPS the technical wording.

This is a display-string rename only: the P1 owner ruling stays intact — reasoning is
collapsed-by-default, debug-viewable, and the public reply is scrubbed of reasoning (the
roundReplyText vs roundReasoningText channel split is UNTOUCHED). Those invariants are pinned here
too so the rename can never quietly regress them.
