"""PROD P0: a player's own message must render in its bubble VERBATIM, every time.

ROOT CAUSE
----------
User bubbles were rendered through `markdownModule.processWithThinking(text)` in
`chatRenderer.js` (the role === 'user' branch + the doc-edit sub-branch). In the
game build, `processWithThinking` runs the MODEL-REASONING leak scrubbers
(`scrubReasoningPreamble` + `redactRawIds`) on the text REGARDLESS OF ROLE. Those
drop whole leading lines matching `_REASONING_LINE_RE` (markdown.js): "let me",
"looking at", "i need", "i'll", "i will", "so,? i", "based on the", ... So a player
message like "I'll get them out!", "Let me think about it.", "I need to talk to
you", "So I think we vote out X" rendered BLANK — its line scrubbed as if it were
model reasoning. The server stored the text verbatim (the model replied fine); the
bubble was just empty.

FIX
---
The USER-role render bypasses the reasoning-scrub pipeline: user text renders with
the base markdown renderer `mdToHtml` (+ the emoji `svgifyEmoji` pass to mirror the
old emoji behavior), NOT `processWithThinking`. User messages never contain <think>
blocks, operator asides, or raw npc:<id> reasoning leaks, so the scrub is both
unnecessary and harmful for them. The same-origin inline-image upgrade (an uploaded
casting photo → ![..](/api/orwell/portrait/<id>)) lives in `mdToHtml`, so it still
fires. The ASSISTANT/AI bubble path is UNCHANGED — the reasoning scrub +
operator-aside/npc-leak scrub stay for model output (the channel split / Vault).

The tests below FAIL on the pre-fix source (user branch calls processWithThinking,
whose scrub blanks these openers) and PASS after.
