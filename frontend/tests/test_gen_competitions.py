"""Feature #1400 (FE lane) — generative competition design: the model DRESSES the engine's fixed roll.

The FE reads the staging view (the engine's ALREADY-FIXED winner + drop order), authors a theme +
per-round fiction, and writes it back — where the engine RE-VALIDATES against the fixed drop order and
REJECTS any mismatch (the 0042 floor then stands). Per the write-back pattern the orchestrator takes
INJECTED deps (staging/llm/write), so the whole lane is testable with no live model or engine. HARD
rule: roles only — no cast names.
