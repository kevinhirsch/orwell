"""Shared Playwright helper: open the Settings modal deterministically past the
pre-game onboarding overlays.

Root cause of the #925/#1148/#930 "onboarding-scrim" flake (deterministic in CI,
invisible to plain local runs), established by direct DOM probing of this exact
no-engine boot:

Two *transient full-screen overlays* cover the Settings gear (#user-bar-settings)
and defeat Playwright's HIT-TESTED ``page.click`` (which waits for the target
point to actually receive the event):

  1. ``#app-loader`` — the boot spinner (``position:fixed; inset:0;
     z-index:99999``). It is removed when ``loadSessions()`` resolves OR by a hard
     ~5s fallback timer (static/index.html). On a *loaded* CI runner it is still
     up past the test's fixed 4s wait, so ``page.click`` on the gear times out on
     it (``document.elementFromPoint(gear) === #app-loader``). The old converge
     loop only ever checked for the onboarding window/scrim, never this loader —
     so it timed out with ``{onboarding: None, scrims: 0, settingsConnected:
     False}``, the exact CI signature.
  2. the F5 "Big Brother engine unavailable" holding card (this suite runs the FE
     with NO TS engine, so ``route()``'s ``fetchState()`` 502s and mounts it). It
     is ``modal:true`` — its scrim covers the gear AND it inerts the sidebar (the
     gear becomes non-interactive) — and ``route()`` re-mounts it on every
     ``orwell:models-changed`` (models.js fires that on the model-scan none→some
     edge, which the pre-seeded endpoint here guarantees), so it *recurs*.

A RAW JS ``.click()`` on the gear opens Settings reliably whenever the gear is not
``inert`` (verified) — the click handler + ``settingsModule.open()`` are fine; the
only failure was Playwright's hit-tested click being intercepted by these overlays
(no product bug). And the holding card's ``[data-ob-dismiss]`` runs
``win.destroy()`` SYNCHRONOUSLY (removes the scrim + un-inerts the sidebar in the
same tick, per orwellWindow.js).

So the robust, deterministic recipe is:
  * wait out ``#app-loader`` (honest boot readiness), then
  * each pass, ATOMICALLY (one ``page.evaluate`` = one JS microtask): dismiss any
    onboarding card via its own ``[data-ob-dismiss]`` (synchronous teardown →
    gear un-inerted) and immediately JS-dispatch the gear ``.click()`` — before any
    async ``orwell:models-changed`` can re-mount the card and re-inert the gear.
    The JS click also bypasses the app-loader's z-index cover.

This opens ``#settings-modal`` deterministically regardless of overlay timing,
without depending on out-racing an async re-mount and without an engine-state stub
(stubbing ``/api/orwell/state`` healthy triggers game-mode sidebar hiding — wrong).
