"""#1336 — the #1313 house-entry-gate residuals, formalized.

Residual (1) — the STATUS-POLL race. The engine flips ``started=True`` internally the instant
createCharacter commits, while the gate HOLDS the tool return for the authoring wait. The
``_house_entry_overlay`` mask in ``routes/orwell_routes.py`` is the latch (kept — no new
castingHouse phase enum); this file formalizes its DoD: **the status projection can never claim
``started`` while the entry gate holds**, proven by polling /status and /state concurrently DURING
a stubbed slow authoring pass. The FE-side gap is closed by stamping the hold marker synchronously
with the committed create result (zero awaits in between, ``src/tool_implementations.py``).

(Scope note: the mask is FE-process-side. The sub-millisecond cross-process window while the
engine's HTTP response is still in flight is not closable by an FE mask — an engine-side
``castingHouse`` phase would be the future option if it ever matters.)

Residual (3) — gate-wait UX. During the hold the player used to see only the generic tool-running
node; the "Production is finalizing your casting…" card fired only on the tool RESULT. chat.js now
paints it at ``tool_start`` for createCharacter, so the holding copy shows for the whole wait
(source-pinned here; the card itself is exercised in the browser lane —
test_1336_finalizing_card_browser.py).

Residual (2) — the prewarmed-branch #976 fall-through (ADR 0013) — is covered in
test_adr0013_photo_requires_authoring.py.

Roles only — every string is a generic probe, never cast material.
