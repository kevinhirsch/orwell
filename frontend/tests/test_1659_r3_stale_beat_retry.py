"""#1659 R3 / audit A-S3 — the STALE-BEAT RETRY PROTOCOL for model-driven progression.

Owner ruling 2026-07-16 (issue #1659, failure seam 3): "StaleBeatError is a dead end."
`advanceGame → StaleBeatError` was never retried — the model free-ran on a beat that never
committed — and a `recordInteraction` stale-drop was ledger-invisible with no re-fold (the
`docs/REFACTOR-ROADMAP.md` A-S3 latent, live). R3: on a 409 `stale-beat`, refresh beatSeq → retry
ONCE → if still stale, reconcile through the desync path; every rejection ledger-visible.

The FE-issued pre-resolve advance already ran this protocol (S1a/RC1, `_pre_resolve_npc_ceremony`);
the residual seam was the MODEL-driven progression tools (`do_advance_game` / `do_submit_decision` /
`do_turn_in`), which reconciled and RETURNED THE CURRENT BOARD without re-firing. This gate pins the
new shared `retry_progression_after_stale` helper + its wiring into all three tools:

  (a) a 409 stale-beat triggers exactly ONE refresh+retry that then succeeds (the progression LANDS);
  (b) a persistent stale (still 409 after retry) reconciles via the desync path AND is recorded
      RED-with-disposition in the ledger (never a silent dead-end);
  (c) the stale rejection is ledger-visible (counted) in both cases;
  (d) no double-apply on retry — the SAME at-most-once idempotency key rides both attempts, so an
      engine that already committed the first (a socket race) dedups the retry.

Roles only; the engine client is faked so we capture the exact tokens/keys the FE passes.
