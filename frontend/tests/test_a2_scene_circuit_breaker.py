"""A2 (2026-07-03 final pre-ship audit) — the SCENE-level circuit-breaker + wrong-identity board guard.

The live red-team found the model fabricates closed-set outcomes wholesale even when the engine is up:
"you won HOH" narrated THREE times with zero tool calls (the engine truth: the player dropped mid-comp,
an NPC won), plus a phantom eviction and a faked nomination ceremony. The pre-existing pre-emission guard
was ineffective — it excised only the winner SENTENCE and shipped the surrounding phantom scene, and it
only checked identity on an un-moved field. This suite pins the three hardening pieces:

  (a) a whole-SCENE circuit-breaker (`screen_streamed_scene_break`) that rejects the entire fabricated
      scene, not one sentence — and fails CLOSED when the engine can't be reached while a board change
      is claimed (anti-sycophancy mandate #3);
  (b) wrong-IDENTITY detection for HOH / veto (the model crowns the wrong person, or tells the PLAYER
      they won a title the engine handed to someone else); and
  (c) the agent-loop wiring that emits a diegetic feeds-cut line in place of the lie.

Roles only: throwaway proper nouns appear INSIDE narration strings to exercise the regexes, exactly as
the sibling spine tests do, and never carry test intent.
