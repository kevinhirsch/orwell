"""Queue C21 (slice) — the house TALLY + self-status badge.

#955: the status panel originally listed every houseguest by name ("The House · 16/16" +
a full text roster). That per-person name list DUPLICATED the cast photo gallery
(#orwell-cast, which shows photos + names + eviction grayscale), so it was removed — the
cast gallery is now the single roster surface. The status panel keeps only the at-a-glance
attrition count ("The House · N/N"), the self role badge, and the premiere objective, all
from the engine's already-Vault-free getGameState().house[] and the public ceremony status.
Static source contract (the HUD is pure JS), plus a Vault-free guard that the tally consumes
only public facets.
