"""Thinking / public split (P1, owner ruling 2026-06-20).

The model's output was MIXING its private reasoning (drafts, self-correction, "let me
rewind that") with its public, in-character narration in the SAME chat bubble. They must
be CLEANLY SEPARATED in the UI:

  - Public, in-character narration -> the normal chat bubble (clean; no reasoning/drafts).
  - Thinking / reasoning            -> a condensed "Thinking" accordion, DEFAULT-COLLAPSED,
                                       streaming while generating, expandable for debug.

This is a FE rendering/stream-separation change only (no engine changes, no new server
path). The reasoning arrives EITHER as a separate provider channel (DeepSeek/vLLM
`reasoning_content` / `reasoning` / `thinking` deltas, which llm_core.py already emits as
`{delta, thinking:true}` SSE chunks, wrapped by chat.js into <think>…</think>) OR inlined
as <think>…</think> in the content. Both are split: reasoning -> accordion, reply -> bubble.

Vault Wall: the accordion shows ONLY the model's own reasoning over Vault-free context — no
new engine secret/Vault path is introduced. The reply text is still scrubbed of any reasoning
preamble so nothing reasoning-shaped reaches the public bubble.

Source-level assertions (the render/stream files are vanilla JS with no JS test runner here)
plus a Node round-trip through the pure scrub helper proving the public reply carries no
reasoning, and the CSS contract proving the accordion defaults collapsed.
