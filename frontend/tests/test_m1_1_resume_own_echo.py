"""M1-1 (audit A1) — the resume own-echo duplicate: source pins.

The intermittent double-render: a tab's OWN streamed turn settles, the deferred peer-resume
flush (ADR 0012 GAP 1) then re-attaches to the just-finished run, and `resumeStream` replays
the same reply into a fresh bubble beside the settled one. The fix is a CONVERGENCE KEY,
never content-equality: the replayed `message_saved` carries the server-minted DB id, and a
bubble already holding that `data-db-id` aborts the resume before anything paints. Paint is
batched per network chunk so a settled run's one-burst replay (whose message_saved rides the
same chunk as its deltas) can never flash a transient duplicate frame.

Ship-gate F5 refinement: the abort is now SCOPED to the own-echo case. A matching bubble that
came from a from-history reconcile (`data-fromHistory="1"`) is a LATE-ATTACHING OBSERVER'S
static render — aborting there would strand the mirror window on the non-incremental reconcile.
For that case the resume REMOVES the static bubble and renders the turn LIVE through the shared
incremental renderer instead (createStreamRenderer). The own-echo abort (a bubble THIS tab
live-rendered itself, NOT from history) is preserved unchanged.
