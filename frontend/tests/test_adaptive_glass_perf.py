"""adaptiveGlass.js — PERFORMANCE hardening (#1315) SOURCE-PINS.

The dominant glass/transcript cost was adaptiveGlass's per-scheduled-tick re-walk of EVERY
`.msg-ai` bubble — O(transcript) work (getBoundingClientRect + canvas getImageData + inline
style writes, read↔write interleaved) fired dozens of times per streamed reply. This gate pins
the three structural fixes so they can't silently regress:

  1. SCOPED PASS — a chat DOM mutation marks only the AFFECTED bubbles dirty
     (`_collectAdaptive` → `_markElDirty`), so a streamed reply costs O(changed bubbles).
     A "full" trigger (scroll/resize/theme/backdrop) still re-samples everything (`_allDirty`).
  2. BATCHED READS — the pass reads ALL rects (+ one backdrop sample each) in a READ PHASE,
     THEN flushes all style writes in a WRITE PHASE — no per-element layout thrash. applyTo
     takes a cached rect + a presample so the write phase does zero layout reads.
  3. VIEWPORT CAP — bubbles far outside the viewport are skipped (the wallpaper is fixed →
     they are re-sampled on the scroll that brings them near).

The visual OUTPUT for on-screen bubbles is unchanged (same polarity/scrim/ink math via the
untouched resolveBubbleScrim/apcaContrast helpers). The FE has no DOM runtime in pytest, so
these are source-pinned like the sibling glass gates. Roles only, no names, no engine/network.
