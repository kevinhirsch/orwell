"""#621 — FE-Python roundup (FEPY-1 / FEPY-2 / FEPY-5) + #611 search-provider fallback.

FEPY-1: a mid-stream upstream error must surface as a typed `error` SSE (a styled FE notice), never
        a reply-channel body delta that reads as in-fiction producer narration.
FEPY-2: an answer routed entirely into the reasoning channel (empty body) must be RE-EMITTED as a
        non-thinking body delta, not left as a blank GM bubble.
FEPY-5: a rejected/odd recordCastProfile write-back must LOG (not silently no-op).
#611:   the search DDG provider prefers the maintained `ddgs` import, falls back to the legacy name.
