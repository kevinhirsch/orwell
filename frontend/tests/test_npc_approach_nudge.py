"""NPC approaches come through CHAT, never a notification panel (owner ruling 2026-06-18).

The player-facing "Wants a word" surface was removed because an NPC wanting to connect is in-fiction
intent — it must reach the player through the dialogue (the GM voices the approach), not a UI panel
that hands NPCs a one-way notification advantage. To keep the social life alive without the panel, the
agent loop nudges the GM to voice an organic approach in the LINGERING window (a lull that hasn't gone
stale enough to advance the week). The scene that follows is real social play that folds into the
hidden weights (the consequence loop) — so the approach is recorded, never just narrated.
