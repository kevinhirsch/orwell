"""#1154 / ADR 0016 §D — FORCE the engine call (`tool_choice`) at the closed-set beats where a missed
call is catastrophic. Now possible because the OOB narrator is GLM-4.7 (PR #1151), which HONORS
`tool_choice` (DeepSeek-V4 rejected `required` in always-thinking mode — `tool_choice` was therefore
DELIBERATELY never sent before this feature, per the 2026-06-21 conformance audit).

Two layers, both driven for real (the suite STUBS the LLM, so the live "does GLM actually honor the
forced call" check is OWED separately — these pin the WIRE + the gate):

  • llm_core: `tool_choice` reaches the OpenAI-style payload when passed, ALONGSIDE `tools`; and is
    ABSENT BY DEFAULT ⇒ byte-identical to before (the safety contract). Interop with the reasoning
    budget: forcing rides its own payload key and never perturbs `reasoning` (reasoning stays on its own
    channel — never the public bubble).
  • agent_loop: the pure `_forced_tool_choice_for_beat` gate fires at the right ENGINE-OWNED beats
    (comp → named advanceGame, #1319 — never a bare "required", since `runCompetition` is a no-op once
    a staged comp is already in progress; ceremony advance → named advanceGame; previewed-uncommitted →
    named advanceGame) and NOT on ordinary turns, never forces submitDecision, and is suppressed by an
    open player pending; plus the model-rejecter gate (DeepSeek-V4 never gets forced) and the
    kill-switch default.

Roles only (no names as data).
