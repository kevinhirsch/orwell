"""#1744 [L-F2/F7] — intro/casting re-ask loops: the defensive framing hardening.

Two live-observed re-ask relapses, mitigated FE-side (the golden gates stub the LLM, so live-verify
across >=3 seeds is owed; this pins the defensive framing that ships in the meantime):

  F2 — premiere roll-call relapse: the champagne-circle gate re-demanded the player's identity
       (name / hometown / job / one real thing) despite casting having it on file. FIX: a premiere-only
       framing note that states the identity is ESTABLISHED (on file from casting) so the beat is a
       GREETING, not a fresh identity demand. It rides ONLY a started game at the premiere moment (the
       engine reports a `premiere` view), NOT a casting turn.

  F7 — casting question-sail: the interviewer re-asked ANSWERED questions for ~8 turns. FIX: a casting
       framing note that forbids re-asking an answered question and finalizes once the required fields
       are on file. It rides EVERY pre-game (casting) turn — kills the RE-ASK, not the finalize variance.

Source-pinned (the notes exist and are wired into the framing path) + behavioral (drive
`apply_game_framing` with a fake engine at the premiere moment vs. the casting moment and assert the
right note appears in the right place, and not the other).
