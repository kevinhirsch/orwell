"""Ledger L15 (FE source gate) — the Cast panel never goes dark during generation.

Pins the orwellCast.js behaviors that stop "all photos vanished + the connection looked dropped":
  • the gate poll (refreshGate) does NOT hide the cast button / close the panel on a non-ok or
    ambiguous /state answer — only a definitive `started:false` does;
  • render() consumes the server's live `generation` record (poll fast while a run is active) and
    treats a `stale` payload as a keep-the-faces signal, never an empty grid;
  • the "Generating N of M…" copy reads the live run record when present.

Source-level assertions (like test_g22) — CODE identifiers, never comment prose. Roles only.
