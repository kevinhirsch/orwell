"""FE agent-loop fixes from the 2026-06-26 BB-nerd-auditor synthesis (Lane A).

Three disjoint, in-loop error-correction belts — each surfaces / steers an engine-authored beat the
model skipped, and NEVER authors content:

* F2 (#1017) — empty-response dead-end. A TRUE-empty live-game turn surfaced only a bare operator
  string ("switch to a different model") with no in-game recourse. The fix surfaces an in-character
  producer line AND a `truncated`-type retry affordance (the existing `Continue ▸` pattern). The
  FEPY-2 reasoning-recovery branch (load-bearing for Flash) stays unchanged, and the non-game
  workspace path still emits the verbatim operator string.

* F8 (#1015) — nomination ceremony never narrated (NPC HOH self-advances the phase, so the moment
  fragment never surfaces and "nominations" wasn't in the steered set). The fix GENERALIZES the
  `_eviction_reveal_steer` into a ceremony-narration belt that steers the model to voice a
  just-resolved `nominations` / `veto-ceremony` beat — the engine already authored the content; the
  belt corrects the omission and never invents noms.

* #1033 (F-4 / F-2) — casting-seam stall guardrail. The L39-family forced finalize already escapes a
  stuck casting cold-start; #1033 adds surfacing the engine's new `createRefusedReason` on a refused
  createCharacter so the loop has a diagnosis instead of silently re-looping.

Every automated gate stubs the LLM, so the steers' live narration quality is live-verified (per the
audit). These pin the pure helpers (fail-before/pass-after) + the source wiring.
