"""Issue #1726 (A2) — the STRUCTURAL presence guard (the "Guard" half of the issue's 3-part spec;
the "Bind" half — the terminal whereabouts occupancy pin — is a separate change to the narrator
prompt).

A live A/B on `z-ai/glm-4.7` (reasoning-off) found the existing next-turn-only nudge
(`_presence_desync_directive` / `record_post_turn_presence_check`, feature 0076) insufficient on its
own: the terminal binding pin alone only cut the phantom-placement failure rate 5/6 -> 3/6, never to
zero (issue #1726 comment, 2026-07-21). "Location does NOT bind on wording alone" — a STRUCTURAL,
SAME-TURN guard is required, mirroring `screen_knowledge_wall`'s DROP posture rather than 0076's
gentler re-ground-only posture.

This module tests the two new pieces:
  (a) `screen_presence_wall` — drops a sentence that stages an off-scene/evicted houseguest as
      present, BEFORE the text reaches the player (same-turn, sibling to `screen_knowledge_wall`).
  (b) `_presence_omission_directive` — detects the inverse (PARITY-8): the engine places houseguests
      in the player's room, but narration never surfaces any of them at all ("room population never
      updates").

Roles only: houseguest display names are throwaway role words, exercising the regexes exactly as the
sibling 0076 / knowledge-wall guard tests do; no name carries test intent.
