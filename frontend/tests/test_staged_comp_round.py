"""0006 staged-rounds evolution (FE side) — the per-round competition prompt.

A competition now plays out in VISIBLE elimination rounds: each round the player picks their approach
for THAT round (compete / throw / play-safe) based on who is still in. Anti-sycophancy is preserved PER
ROUND — the structured per-round selection is committed before the round resolves and posted ENGINE-DIRECT
(never read from prose), and a finished round can't be re-labeled. These tests pin the FE relay + barrier:

  1. the relay accepts `comp-round` as a valid binding decision kind and forwards the STRUCTURED `intent`
     (never prose) engine-direct;
  2. the pending barrier HARD-BLOCKS the model from narrating a comp result past an open `comp-round`
     (the engine, never the model, decides who survives — so a past round can't be re-labeled);
  3. the per-round prompt re-issues each round (the engine surfaces a fresh `comp-round` pending with the
     narrowed still-in field) and the relay forwards each one independently.

Roles only — no names.
