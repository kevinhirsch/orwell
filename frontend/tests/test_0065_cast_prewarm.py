"""Feature 0065 — cast pre-warm orchestration (FE side).

The hard invariant: a FULLY WARMED AUTHORSHIP before any portrait is ever generated. Author warm runs
the deep authoring in the background as early as possible; portrait warm is held and WAITS for author
warm to finish before it shoots a single face. Deps are injected, so the whole gate is testable with no
live model, engine, or image provider.
