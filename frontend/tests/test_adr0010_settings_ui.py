"""ADR 0010 / feature 0069 — the Token Economy admin settings UI is wired.

Source-pins (matching test_s1s2_settings_wiring.py's convention): the controls exist in index.html,
`initTokenEconomySettings` reads/writes `/api/auth/settings` for every token-economy key, the per-class
`reasoning_budget` dict is rebuilt from the four selects, and the OpenRouter provider JSON is validated
before save. The POST /settings route already persists these DEFAULT_SETTINGS keys
(test_adr0010_admin_token_economy.py covers the route + the keys).
