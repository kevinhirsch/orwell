"""Lane 6 — FE framing & turn integrity (2026-06-10 full-product-audit findings).

Covers, with behavior-level tests wherever the seam allows:
  P2  — the re-entry moment is requested on the first game turn of a (re)opened session;
  P8  — single datetime header + the slim prompt-safety policy on framed game-build turns;
  E16 — player-authored preset personas never ride the GM stack on a game turn;
  E94 — an attachment on a game turn adds the one-line "the player is showing something"
        scene framing while the GM framing stays intact;
  E22 — the server-side guard for "narrated but never recorded" (code, not prompt wording);
  E23 — the agent contract forbids blind retries of committing tools (pinned in c14);
  E24/P7 — incognito cannot strip game framing under the game build;
  E25 — the sync route refuses a game turn BEFORE persisting the user message;
  E29 — orwell routes resolve the EFFECTIVE user (bearer tokens map to their real owner);
  W2  — the per-session SSE event stream verifies session ownership.

Roles only — no houseguest names; tool/vertical names are app capabilities.
