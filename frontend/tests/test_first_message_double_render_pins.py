"""Source pins for the first-message double-render fix (#1087 SSE self-echo parity).

These run in the fast `fe-unit` lane (no browser) so a revert of any leg fails immediately — the
behavioral fail-before/pass-after proof lives in `test_first_message_double_render.py` (browser lane).

The bug: `session_events` is at-least-once, so a window received its OWN `run-started` echo while its
foreground POST was still rendering that run; sessionSync could not tell its own echo from a genuine
PEER run, deferred a peer-resume of its OWN run, and at stream end re-attached to the just-finished run
(evict grace) — painting a duplicate the reconcile then collapsed ("appears twice then dedupes"). The
fix gives the SSE `run-started` edge a run id (the WS edge already had it, #1087) so the sender can
recognize and skip its own run; a genuine peer run (different runId) still resumes/defers (GAP-1 kept).
