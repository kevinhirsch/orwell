"""T0-6 — the ONE Casting Bible (FacetLedger). Pins the backlog item's acceptance criteria
(docs/audits/2026-07-21-campaign-report-and-exhaustive-backlog.md §T0-6/§T9;
docs/design/2026-07-21-moonshot-refactor-synthesis.md §P3):

  * a cast-wide seeded FacetLedger, minted BEFORE any LLM call, dealing every slot a hand from
    stratified per-cast budgets (vocation family, region/hometown, heightBuild, skinTone, hair,
    voice tics, name phonology) — deterministic (same seed ⇒ same hands), no Date.now()/random();
  * zero facet triple-dups (the structural FACET_DUP_CAP guarantee) across a sweep of seeds;
  * zero duplicate COMMITTED hometowns/vocations even in a single 15-wide wave (the collision-drop
    added to `_gather_chunked_proposal`);
  * a 15-NPC cast now runs genesis in ONE full-width wave, not 3 sequential chunks;
  * `author_cast` threads each NPC's dealt hand + the cast-wide taken-list into its prompt, and the
    transactional adopt-or-regenerate guard (never graft) fires on a closed-facet conflict.

Roles only — no names ingested as data. All LLM calls in the async sections are stubbed.
