"""FE fixes — #1045 (F16 guard single-tenant + running-count regexes), #1034 (casting framing),
#1019 / F9 (pending-aware framed beat key).

These exercise three chat_helpers fixes the live drive surfaced:

  • #1045 part 1 — the pre-emission outcome guard keyed its per-turn baseline on `user`; under a
    single-tenant path (AUTH_ENABLED=false) `user=None`, so the baseline was effectively inert and
    the guard FAILED OPEN every turn. The fix keys the desync stores via `_desync_key` — `user` when
    present, else the canonical game-session id — so the guard functions single-tenant too. Cross-user
    isolation must stay intact (a real user always keys on its own identity, never the session).
  • #1045 part 2 — the eviction-claim regexes missed live running-count phrasings ("eight votes to
    evict", "nine to one … eleven to evict", "unanimous", "out of the house/game"). The engine NEVER
    counts (anonymized ballots only), so ANY tally / "N to M" / committed-exit narrated before the
    engine's eviction commit is a fabrication to HOLD.
  • #1034 — the casting framing must keep the producer persona (no "drop the persona"), stay out of an
    informal/meta register, and avoid degenerate ultra-terse turns.
  • #1019 / F9 — a comp-intent submitted via the decision-card POST resolves the engine's `pending`
    WITHOUT moving (week, phase, moment); folding the open pending's `kind` into the framed beat key
    lets a resolved pending flip peer-advance detection. Back-compat: NO open pending → the original
    3-tuple key (byte-identical).

Roles only — proper nouns inside narration strings are throwaway tokens exercising the regexes, never
canonical cast.
