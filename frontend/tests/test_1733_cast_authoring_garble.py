"""Issue #1733 (E1) — cast-authoring emits garbled/gender-incoherent voice cues rendered verbatim as
authoritative identity by the narrator. BB-Nerd audit F7/F8: a 32-year-old WOMAN authored "patient and
fatherly" (a gendered self-descriptor with no pronoun — the existing #1660 F2 pronoun-only lint never
sees it), mixed-script junk landed in a voice cue ("缺乏 voice — static and unboiling"), and a raw
"empty" dial value (`humor: "none"`) rendered as grammatically-broken "none humor" through the fixed
`voiceFingerprint` template. Root cause pinned to the cast-authoring call running at a hot sampling
temperature (`cast_authoring_temperature`, default 1.0, owner ruling 2026-07-20).

This extends the F2 author-time coherence lint (`orwell_cast_authoring.coherence_conflicts` /
`voice_conflicts`) and adds a gender-agnostic genesis-time lint (`orwell_cast_genesis.
_is_garbled_or_gendered`, wired into `parse_genesis_proposal`) so none of the three garble classes ever
reach `recordCastProfile` / `recordCastGenesis` — a rejected field is DROPPED (never persisted) and
falls to the deterministic seeded floor, matching the existing fail-soft "no model ⇒ floor stands"
pattern. Roles only — every probe string is generic (no houseguest names).
