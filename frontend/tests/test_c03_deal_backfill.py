"""0039 deal back-fill: a struck deal the model narrates but never makeDeal's is recorded by the FE.

Found in live play (continuation of the C-02/C-03 tool-under-calling class): the GM narrated a sealed
mutual deal ("you have my word", a no-nominate pact) and skipped makeDeal — so the deal bound no one,
never reconciled against later play, and the deals surface stayed empty. The FE now back-fills makeDeal
via a HIGH-bar constrained extraction: only a clear, explicit, MUTUAL agreement is recorded, so loose
"let's work together" chatter never becomes a phantom commitment.
