"""L-F3 (#1742) — interactive beats soft-lock on exact phrasing.

An interactive beat (a premiere intro, a comp buzz-in) gates on a *specific* expected action and
used to stall INDEFINITELY on anything else: the live playtest repro looped the identical HOH-comp
trivia question 15 straight turns because "Let's keep the week moving — what's next?" was never
read as an answer. Root cause: the lull-gated advance-nudge (`_is_lull` + `_stale`) and the L39b
safety net both assume the player either disengages (a lull) or the model eventually calls the
tool it's waiting on — neither catches an ENGAGED player whose replies never match the exact
phrase the model invented, so `_is_lull` stays False turn after turn and the gate is re-presented
forever.

This module pins the fix: a loop-detection belt independent of the lull gate (fires on repetition
of the identical framed gate with an engaged-but-non-matching reply), plus the fix to
`_commit_advance_silently`'s false-success path (calling advanceGame against an open player
pending is a documented no-op, but used to be treated as real progress, silently resetting every
stall counter and letting the loop persist with no escalation ever landing).
