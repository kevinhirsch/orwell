"""B66 — the augment-not-replace guard (ADR 0003 §4), structurally.

UI may AUGMENT the chat but never REPLACE a game-building interaction: no front-end UI
route/control may reach a game-PROGRESSING engine action except the two sanctioned,
explicitly-confirmed paths — the decision route (the C20 confirm card posts the player's
selection engine-direct) and the new-game route (guarded by a 409 unless confirm=true).
Everything else progressing belongs to the AGENT path (src/tool_implementations.py),
where the model acts inside the conversation. This mirrors the engine's dependency-cruiser
Vault rule at the front-end layer: a registry/source assertion, not a convention.
