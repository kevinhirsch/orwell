"""#830 — optimistic-always user bubble + AGGREGATED unsent send queue.

Builds ON the #1379 reload-durable outbox (test_891_reload_durable_outbox.py) — the queue, the
per-item at-most-once machinery, the durability and the honest status tags are all #891's; #830
adds the AGGREGATION lane on top:

  1. OPTIMISTIC-ALWAYS — the user's message paints as a bubble synchronously on submit in EVERY
     path (BUG-1 covered the no-model/no-session materialize branches; #985 the send-while-
     streaming enqueue; #891 the offline enqueue). The one remaining stranded state — a DECLINED
     API-key confirm left a ghost `msg-pending` bubble that would never dispatch while the text
     stayed in the composer — now removes the stale bubble (the words remain in the composer:
     never invisible, never doubled).

  2. AGGREGATED ONE-TURN DRAIN — the owner's ruling: "aggregate what you send quickly … when it's
     time to send the payload it sends all messages in one turn." Items queued WHILE A TURN WAS
     STREAMING carry `coalesce: true`; at drain time a same-lane run of them folds into ONE
     combined turn (`_foldOutboxBatch`): one payload (texts joined by a blank line, order kept),
     ONE clientMsgId (the head's — the batch's single idempotency key), ONE bubble (the separate
     pending bubbles collapse into a single combined bubble through the same render path), ONE
     server row — so live, persisted and peer views all converge. A single queued item — and every
     OFFLINE-queued / network-requeued / reload-restored item — dispatches byte-identical to the
     per-item #891 path (each of those is its own at-most-once unit; folding items with divergent
     delivery states could double- or half-send a batch). That split is exactly why this composes
     with, rather than regresses, the #1379 gates.

  3. AGGREGATED AFFORDANCE — when ≥2 items sit queued, one status strip above the composer
     (`#send-queue-strip`, role="status", REAL text nodes — the WCAG 4.1.3 .unsent-tag precedent)
     shows the count + the one-turn/offline truth + a manual "Send now" retry that resets the
     backoff and drains through the ONE normal flush ("retry re-sends the batch"). The strip is a
     pure PROJECTION of the outbox — no queue state of its own, no second send path.

Like #985/#891 this is an LLM-stub-blind seam, so the runtime gates drive the REAL chat.js in
headless chromium.
