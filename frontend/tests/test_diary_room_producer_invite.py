"""The producer's Diary-Room INVITATION (0013 §5 / PG-14 / PS-4).

Big Brother's signature backstage ritual is the producer pulling the player aside for a
confessional at a dramatic beat. The engine's `producerPrompt` was built for exactly this and had
ZERO live callers — so the invitation NEVER fired in real play (dead code). It is now live-wired:
`GameSessionAdapter.view()` sets `GameStateView.diaryRoomInvite` at a dramatic beat, and
`apply_game_framing` turns that flag into a one-shot producer aside inviting the player in.

Two guarantees this file pins:
  (a) the invite now FIRES at the intended beat (and only once per beat — an invitation, not a nag);
  (b) the invite preserves the Diary Room's ONE-WAY OOC wall — its directive never opens a pathway
      from Diary-Room content to any NPC's knowledge (that wall is structural in the engine; the
      framing text must never contradict it).
