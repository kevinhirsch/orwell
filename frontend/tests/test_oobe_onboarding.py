"""OOBE re-sequence (2026-06-20) — the welcome-first, photo-mid-interview onboarding flow.

The target flow, in order:
  1. Settings → LLM info (the model gate, J4).
  2. A WELCOME MODAL (its own modal, never folded into the chat) — shown on EVERY fresh game/season.
     Dismissing it opens the fresh interview session AND fires the producers' kickoff.
  3. The PRODUCERS reach out FIRST — the casting interview opens with a producer-initiated message
     (no player "start the conversation" pre-prompt), and the producers ask about the CAST PHOTO.
  4. The cast-photo box appears MID-interview (engine-gated on state.casting.missing including
     "castPhoto" + a rendered producer turn). It is OPTIONAL/skippable and does NOT lock the chat.
  5. The casting interview (the engine's character-creation moment → updateCasting → createCharacter).
  6. House entry + a LIGHT-TOUCH guided first week (the agent-loop pacing leans expeditious in week 1,
     NO scripted rails).

OOBE re-sequence reversed the OLD photo-FIRST, hard-locked flow: the chat is no longer locked for
the photo (orwellChatGate.js is retired to a no-op), the welcome shows every fresh season, and the
photo box follows the producers' question instead of preceding the interview.

These are source-pins (the FE pytest lane has no DOM runtime; the live DOM is covered by the
browser smoke). No fixture names — roles only.
