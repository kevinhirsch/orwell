"""Batch C gate #4 (2026-07-11 narrator-prompt audit) — PENDING-HINT semantics.

`chat_helpers._PENDING_KIND_HINTS` steers the model on the SPECIFIC pending decision the player owes.
Each key must be a REAL engine pending-decision kind (a typo / renamed kind silently falls through to
the generic hint, and the specific steering is dead) — and the `comp-round` hint must encode the
engine's once-only ruling (the staged-competition approach is declared ONCE up front and covers the
whole comp; the later rounds are drama over an already-decided result, NOT a fresh choice each round).
The audit found nothing pinned either invariant.

Reads the engine kind union from src/ports/GameSession.ts as text (like test_c13_lever_drift.py).
