"""Feature 0051 — in-character cast portraits (front-end half).

Name-agnostic (roles only). Covers the FE pipeline the spec pins for pytest:
  • generation triggered on createCharacter with portraitPrompts
  • skip (silent) when image generation is unavailable / disabled — game plays identically
  • persistence: a file + manifest entry written; NOT regenerated when already present
  • cast roster route: name + status + portrait ref, and Vault-free (no hidden content)
  • factory/game scrub removes the portraits dir

Generation itself is monkeypatched (deterministic, no image API / no engine).
