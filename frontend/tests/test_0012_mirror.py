"""ADR 0012 — the two-window lockstep "Messenger mirror" behavioral gates.

§3.2 (this file, for now): the `message-added` completion broadcast must fire on the STREAMING
save path (`ChatSession.add_message` → `_persist_message`) — the **dead leg** that previously
bypassed the broadcast living only in `SessionManager.add_message`. With the broadcast moved into
the shared `_persist_message` primitive, EVERY persist path publishes the authoritative `{id, seq}`
exactly once, so two windows reconcile by id instead of drifting until a late poll/reconcile.

Name-agnostic; exercises the real `SessionManager` persist path against the test DB. Roles only.
