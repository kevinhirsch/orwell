"""Issue #1626 (increment 3, FE lane) — the producer-persona deepening driver.

The orchestrator (`author_producer`) takes INJECTED llm + write functions, so the whole lane is
testable without a live model or engine (mirrors `test_0062_zeitgeist_capture` /
`test_l28b_cast_authoring`). We pin: the producer prompt, the tolerant JSON parser (open-set keys
only, name NEVER forwarded), the orchestration (writes the overlay, one strict-JSON reparse,
best-effort/fail-soft), and the live wiring — no model ⇒ NO write-back (the seeded floor stands),
a stub model ⇒ `record_producer_profile` called with the synthesized Vault-free overlay.
