"""Gateway consequence-fold tests (2026-07-22 repo gap audit, finding G1).

THE BUG: every player turn taken through the multi-platform gateway (feature 0072 —
``gateway/handler.py::_call_player_turn``) called only READ engine tools
(``getGameState``/``getMomentPrompt``), narrated, and returned — never ``recordInteraction`` or any
other mutating tool. That silently bypassed the whole consequence/memory loop (mandate #4 / feature
0023) for an entire live client surface, and — since no mutating tool ever fired —
``Orchestrator.commitPlayerTurn``'s per-turn bounded off-screen tick never ran either (see
``src/composition/runtime.ts``'s ``registry.setCommit`` funnel, wired from
``EngineCommandsAdapter.recordInteraction``'s own ``onPersist`` call).

THE FIX: ``gateway/consequence.py::fold_gateway_turn`` is a self-contained mirror of the streaming
agent loop's 0055 ``_auto_record_scene`` belt (it does NOT import ``agent_loop.py``), wired into
``handler.py::_call_player_turn`` right after narration. These tests pin the fix at the
``handle_platform_turn`` boundary — a real gateway turn, a stubbed engine.
