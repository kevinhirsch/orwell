"""#891 finding F1 (P0) — universal idempotencyKey + expectedBeatSeq on the MODEL-DRIVEN progression path.

Context: the engine has the 0065 sync spine (idempotency cache + `beatSeq`/`expectedBeatSeq`/
`idempotencyKey` compare-and-swap), but for a long time the FE attached those tokens ONLY on its own
belts (`agent_loop.py`) — never on the path the LLM itself drives (`do_advance_game`/`do_submit_decision`
in `tool_implementations.py`), which is the COMMON case. A retried POST on a flaky socket could then
double-advance / double-submit (skip a staged eviction ballot, double-crown a finale beat), because
at-most-once was unused exactly where progression fires most.

The fix (`_model_progression_cas` + `_refresh_after_model_progression`) attaches a retry-stable
idempotency key and the FE's last-seen `expectedBeatSeq` on EVERY model-dispatched progression call and
refreshes last-seen from the response. These tests are the issue-#891-traceable regression guard for
that contract on the model path specifically — a refactor that drops the CAS wiring from the do_* impls
must go red here. (The broader CON-1..5 two-window cluster is pinned in `test_two_window_sync_fix.py`;
this file is the focused, named F1 pin.)

The invariant these lock:
  • the model-driven advanceGame/submitDecision/turnIn path is NEVER a bare unguarded engine call —
    with a known last-seen beatSeq, BOTH tokens reach the engine;
  • the idempotency key is RETRY-STABLE (lost-response retry ⇒ same key ⇒ engine replays) but FRESH on a
    genuine next advance (last-seen moved ⇒ new key);
  • expectedBeatSeq is sourced from the SHARED FE beatSeq store (`chat_helpers._LAST_BEAT_SEQ`), not a
    parallel mechanism;
  • a stale-beat 409 reconciles to the CURRENT board — never a second, unintended advance.
