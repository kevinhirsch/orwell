"""NAR-1 (product-review, 2026-07) — the stall/pacing belt lattice must persist state SINGLE-TENANT.

`_FIRST_WEEK_HINT`, `_TURNS_SINCE_PROGRESS`, and `_ADVANCE_STALL_LEVEL` (all in `agent_loop.py`),
plus the `_LAST_FRAMED_BEAT_KEY` read sites that key off `owner`, used a MISMATCHED key between
their write and read sides: several writes were gated `if owner:` / `if owner is not None:` (a
no-op single-tenant) or written under the raw `owner` value, while every read fell back to
`owner or ""` — a DIFFERENT key than either the raw `None` a gated write skipped, or (for
`_LAST_FRAMED_BEAT_KEY`, whose write lives in `chat_helpers.py`) the `"default"` sentinel the
writer actually used.

Net effect under `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (`owner=None` every turn — a legitimate home-deploy
posture and the one the product owner runs): the lull-based stall clock could never go stale, the
L39b forced-advance escalation ladder could never climb past its first rung, the first-week pacing
hint never engaged, and the ADR-0011 peer-advance/framed-beat-key comparison always read empty —
so the ENTIRE reactive stall-nudge/forced-advance belt stood down single-tenant, leaving only the
proactive `tool_choice` force (GLM-only, kill-switch-able) as a net.

This mirrors `test_1014_guard_owner_none.py`'s established shape for this class of bug: a
behavioral round-trip proving write and read now agree under `owner=None`, plus source-pins on
the exact sites. Cross-user isolation is unweakened by construction — a real (truthy) `owner`
always keys on its own identity via `_belt_key`, exactly as before; only the `owner=None` path
changes, from "silently inert" to "shares the single-tenant `default` bucket".
