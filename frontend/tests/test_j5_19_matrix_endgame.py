"""J5-19 — the responsive-matrix endgame sweep exists and is guarded.

scripts/responsive_matrix.py's default stage_game() only creates a FRESH (turn-0) game, so the
endgame surfaces (#orwell-retro self-gates on recap.finished; the endgame decision card needs a
live finale pending) never render under it — leaving the endgame mobile UX asserted by source-
string tests only, never a viewport render. The opt-in finish_game() path fixes that.

These are CHEAP guard checks (import + source), NOT a live matrix run (that needs a real engine and
would race the shared sandbox). They prove the new path is present, opt-in (default OFF), and can
never alter the default fresh-game run.
