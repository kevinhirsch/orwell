"""Engine progression error-correction — the agent-loop stall-nudge.

The GM reliably narrates a beat (a competition, a ceremony, the premiere move-in) WITHOUT
ever calling advanceGame, freezing the season (the #1 playthrough blocker, robust even on
strong models). Per the owner's ruling we keep the dynamic DM and ERROR-CORRECT the omission:
when the live game sits in a phase that exists to be driven forward and the turn fired no
progression tool, nudge the model in-loop — non-disruptive first, escalating, capped, tunable.

Source-pins (the behavior runs against the real engine in the play-through harness).
