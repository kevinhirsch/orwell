"""ADR 0009 (D3 Part A) — the LOCATION grounding barrier (a chat↔board DESYNC class).

Root cause #1 of the chat<->board location desync: room occupancy is grounded by PROMPT TEXT ONLY,
and the model overrides it from its own conversation memory (the same LW9 pattern the comp-round
clamp exists for). The fix surfaces the engine's `whereabouts` as an ENFORCEABLE fact — the current
room + who is present + the adjacent rooms — and pins three hard rules that keep the prose foldable
into the board with NO visible historic conflict (the PO's overriding constraint): an evicted
houseguest is GONE, rooms are limited to the floor plan, and a person is in exactly ONE place at a
time. It DELIBERATELY permits narrated movement (the engine records it, D2) so the house stays
dynamic — only the impossible is forbidden.
