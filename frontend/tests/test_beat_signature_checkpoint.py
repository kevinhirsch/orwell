"""The BEAT-SIGNATURE CHECKPOINT (layer 2 of the chat↔engine desync spine).

The pending-barrier (test_pending_barrier.py) catches the GM narrating PAST an open PLAYER
decision. It cannot catch the OTHER desync class: an advanceGame-driven beat with NO pending,
where the GM narrated an OUTCOME the engine never committed — "X is evicted", crowning the
finale winner a beat early, or a mis-narrated eviction tally. This second layer snapshots the
engine board before/after a turn, diffs the turn's full narration against that delta, and when
the narration asserts an outcome the board never moved on, stashes a forceful RE-GROUND
directive that apply_game_framing injects on the NEXT turn. Field-specific + conservative: a
false alarm is worse than a missed one, so each claim is checked against its own signature field.
