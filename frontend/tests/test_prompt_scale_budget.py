"""Issue #1391 — prompt-scale dilution: a token-count regression gate on the narrator prompt.

MECHANISM this guards against. Every player turn ships the SAME fixed narrator
rulebook (`BASE_GAME_MASTER_PROMPT` in `src/engine/momentPrompts.ts`) — assembled
with the per-turn context it becomes a ~17-20k-token prompt. An LLM's per-rule
COMPLIANCE decays as the rulebook grows: the more instructions crammed into one
always-injected block, the less reliably the model honors ANY single one. That
decay is exactly what the FE under-call belt family (`agent_loop.py`, the forced
`tool_choice` rung, `docs/design/undercall-seam-structural.md`) has to keep
error-correcting — a bigger prompt means MORE skipped tool calls to catch, not
fewer. So the size of the fixed per-turn prompt is a real reliability lever, and
it must not grow SILENTLY: every added rule dilutes the rest.

WHAT THIS GATE DOES. It reads the narrator-prompt SOURCE as text (it never imports
or executes the TypeScript), extracts the `BASE_GAME_MASTER_PROMPT` string literal
(and the sibling casting-phase prompt), measures its assembled size, and asserts it
stays under a pinned ceiling. The audit measured BASE ≈ 43,406 chars (~10.9k tokens)
when #1391 was filed; the assembled literal on this branch measures ~45,144 chars
(~11,286 by the chars/4 token proxy — see below). The ceiling is pinned at the
current measured size plus a modest margin.

RATCHET DIRECTION — this gate only ratchets DOWN.
  * A GROWN prompt (size above the ceiling) FAILS — a new rule block cannot land
    silently; it forces a conscious "trim, move to a fragment, or raise the ceiling
    with rationale" decision.
  * A SHRUNK prompt always PASSES (a smaller prompt is under any ceiling). Trimming
    the rulebook is exactly the win this gate wants; it never penalizes a shrink.

TOKEN PROXY. Real token counts need the model's tokenizer; here we use the standard
rough estimate chars/4 and report it for context only. The HARD assertion is on the
CHARACTER count (deterministic, tokenizer-free, no flake). "~N tokens" in any message
is the chars/4 proxy, NOT an exact tokenization.

SCOPE. This file only GUARDS the size. The prompt RESTRUCTURE itself — moving BASE
rules out into per-beat moment fragments so the always-injected block shrinks — is
SEPARATE, fenced work (issue #1391, other lane). This gate does not touch the prompt.

This is a plain non-browser `fe-unit` test: source-text only, fast, deterministic —
no server, no Playwright. It mirrors the defensive style of the FE source-pin gates
(`test_1412_mutating_manifest.py`, `test_g15_gamechanged.py`): if the literal can't
be located (the file shape changed), it FAILS loudly with an actionable message
rather than silently passing.
