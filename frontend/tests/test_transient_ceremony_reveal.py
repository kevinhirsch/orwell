"""2026-07-03 pre-ship audit — transient-animation lane (TRANS-12 / VM-5).

Ceremony beat outcomes (HOH crown, nomination reveal, veto result, eviction vote
reveal — anything the L42 `orwellBeatOutcome()` line surfaces) used to swap into the
live tool-thread row via a raw `innerHTML` replace with zero motion: the exact
instant a "still working" row flips to the real outcome text had no transition, so
the show's biggest beats landed as a silent, instant state change ("hard pop").

`chat.js` now tags that row `ow-ceremony-reveal` whenever it is rendering a real
`_outcome` (never on a plain "done"/"failed" swap), and `style.css` gives that class
a brief staged entrance (fade + settle) on the row's header — reduced-motion strips
it back to the exact original instant swap. Presentation only: no game state, no
ordering change, no engine-outcome change.

Source-pinned (CSS/JS-as-text) like the other FE chrome gates — the pytest lane has
no DOM runtime; the render behaviour is verified by browser_smoke.py.
