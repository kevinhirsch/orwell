"""L21/L24 auto-move belt: a room the player walks to but the model never moveTo's is persisted by the FE.

Whereabouts cohesion — "the single biggest immersion-killer" (ledger L24). The engine grounding shipped
(whereabouts() in the per-turn context; the player is PINNED and only an explicit `moveTo` relocates them).
But the model reliably UNDER-calls `moveTo`: the player says "I head to the kitchen", the narrator voices
the kitchen, but never moves the engine — so next turn whereabouts still reports the OLD room and the
picture snaps back. The FE now back-fills the move via a constrained extraction: only a room the player
clearly walked to is relayed (room:null → nothing happens), so the engine's persisted occupancy agrees
with the narration the player already saw. Vault-free (whereabouts is a Vault-free projection).
