"""SSE/poll fallback — a mid-stream stall must ABORT + recover, never freeze the turn forever.

The SECOND reproducible live-play freeze (the follow-up to the WS-orphaned-pending freeze fixed in
PR #1718). On the SSE/poll fallback transport in `frontend/static/js/chat.js` the whole-turn abort was
a ONE-SHOT: `clearResponseTimeout()` fired on the FIRST stream activity and permanently disarmed the
timer. So a mid-stream SSE stall (the server stops emitting deltas partway through a turn) left
`await reader.read()` blocked FOREVER with `chatState.isStreaming` stuck true — the same reload-forcing
freeze as the WS one, only partially mitigated by the `visibilitychange` tab-recovery (which needs a
manual tab switch to fire).

The fix converts that abort from a one-shot-cleared timer into an ACTIVITY-RESET IDLE timer
(`_makeStreamIdleGuard`): `.activity()` (re)arms the countdown on stream START and on EVERY subsequent
delta/tool event, so it fires only after a genuine IDLE gap. A long-but-ACTIVE agent turn keeps
resetting it and is never tripped (the false-positive the one-shot-clear originally avoided); only real
silence aborts, driving the SAME recovery the turn already has (abort → catch → reconcile → finally
resets `isStreaming` + re-enables the composer).

Driven against the REAL `_makeStreamIdleGuard` extracted from chat.js and run in Node with a controllable
fake clock. Roles only; no names.
