"""The pending-decision BARRIER (a chat↔engine DESYNC class).

Found in live play: the engine sat BLOCKED on a player decision (a week-2 goodbye-message the
player must author) while the GM role-played PAST it, narrating into week 3. The engine is the
SOURCE OF TRUTH; the fiction must never advance past an unresolved player decision. The fix
injects a forceful GM directive that HARD-BLOCKS the model from narrating any beat past the
pending and pins it to bringing the player to THAT decision. This is the OPPOSITE of C-02 (an
NPC ceremony with no player step, which is pre-resolved for real) — here the player owes the
decision, so we never resolve it for them; we block the model from skipping it.
