"""C28 — the presence strip (feature 0049, FE half): whereabouts() rendered as an AMBIENT,
dismissible ground for lingering play (ADR 0003 §4/§7). The route is read-only and fail-open;
the strip carries no control that progresses the game (the B66 augment guard covers that
structurally — these tests pin the route + mount).
