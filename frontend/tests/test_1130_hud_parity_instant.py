"""Instant cross-window HUD parity — feature 0064 §B/D / ship-gate F5 (the status/gadget half).

The 0064 server-push (`game-updated`) fired from only THREE `orwell_routes.py` endpoints (decision +
the two self-eviction routes) — NEVER from the chat-turn path. So a chat turn whose agent-loop tools
mutate engine state (`markHouseguestMet`, `advanceGame`, `recordInteraction`, …) refreshed only the
SENDER's own HUD (client-side, via the g15 dispatcher); peer windows got no push and stayed stale
until their 20–30s poll (observed live: window A "1 of 15 met", window B "0 of 15").

These gates pin the fix at the source level:
  (a) `publish_game_updated_after_turn` pushes IFF the turn committed a mutation (a game-engine write
      tool ran, or the user's beatSeq advanced) and NO-OPS on a pure OOC/no-op turn (no noise);
  (b) it routes through the shared, Vault-free `orwell_game_session.publish_game_updated` helper
      (a session id + the bare change-type only — no state body);
  (c) the chat-turn DONE seam in `chat_routes.py` calls it on a game turn (source-pin), and chains a
      second push onto the E22/0055 `recordInteraction` fallback task.

No names; role-only. Mirrors `test_617_background_writeback_push.py`.
