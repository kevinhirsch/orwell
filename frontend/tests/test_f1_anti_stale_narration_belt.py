"""F1 — the ANTI-STALE narration guard (2026-07-20 live GLM-4.7 playtest).

The forced-advance belt (L39b) can march the engine ARBITRARILY far ahead of a narration that
stays FROZEN on an earlier beat. The playtest saw the chat never leave the premiere champagne
circle while the engine silently completed TWO FULL WEEKS underneath it: `#1154 forcing
tool_choice={advanceGame}` + `committed advanceGame silently (stall L0)` fired **141 times**,
force-advancing the engine but NEVER voicing the resulting ceremony. Engine and chat decoupled
completely with no on-screen signal.

The existing guards catch the OPPOSITE case (narration running AHEAD of the engine — the
anti-forward-fabrication family). This guard sits BESIDE them for the "narration behind a
silently-advancing engine" direction:

  1) on EVERY silent PLAIN-stall force ("stall L…" — the emitted-visible path that breaks the turn
     silently), OBLIGATE the next narration turn to voice the engine's CURRENT moment, by queuing a
     CLOSED-SET re-ground onto the existing BL-004 `_reground_enqueue` queue (drained by
     apply_game_framing into the GM prompt);
  2) past `_SILENT_FORCE_ADVANCE_CAP` consecutive silent stall-forces with no fresh narration
     catching up, STOP advancing the engine any further ahead — hold the beat and force the
     reground (surface the gap) instead of racing on.

Closed-set only (ADR 0005): the reground points the model at engine truth (the moment the engine is
ACTUALLY on) and authors NO prose. The guard is gated ENTIRELY behind the stall/desync condition —
the clean golden path never triggers it, so it does not stale the golden fixture.
