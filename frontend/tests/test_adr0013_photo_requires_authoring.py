"""ADR 0013 — a cast photo requires a MODEL-AUTHORED identity.

The portrait warm (`orwell_prewarm.warm_portraits`) must shoot a face ONLY when its houseguest's
own authoring gate has fired (a real model write-back via `_on_authored`). An NPC the model could
NOT author — or one stuck behind a total authoring hang — must get NO photo (a seeded/un-authored
face would mismatch the rich authored text the player eventually sees). The portrait backfill shoots
it later, once authoring actually lands.
