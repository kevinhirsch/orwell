"""Gateway publish-game-updated + narration history tests (2026-07-22 R-PAR-4, #1879).

THE BUG: every gateway turn folded consequences but never pushed a game-updated event,
so web sessions never learned about the gateway turn until their next poll (which under
default-ON WS mode is cancelled entirely — orwellStatusPanel.js:852-877).  The gateway's
narration call was also memoryless: it only passed system + user messages, so the gateway
could not remember its own prior replies in the shared transcript surface.

THE FIX:
1. After fold_gateway_turn, call orwell_game_session.publish_game_updated(user) so every
   web device on the user's canonical session reconciles its HUD instantly.
2. Before the narration call, load recent assistant messages from the canonical session
   transcript and inject them into the messages list so the gateway remembers its own
   prior replies.
