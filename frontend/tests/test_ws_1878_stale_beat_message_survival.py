"""#1878 — structural: stale-beat WS turn refusal preserves the player's typed message.

Acceptance criteria:
  • Stale-beat auto-retry once BEFORE the existing cleanup (no text loss).
  • The retry calls sendTurn with _finalMsgWithInject and no explicit expectedBeatSeq (uses lastBeatSeq()).
  • Auto-retry is bounded to exactly one retry (no loop).
  • Composer text is restored via msgEl.value = _finalMsgWithInject in the cleanup path.
  • Non-stale-beat errors also restore the composer text.

The structural approach mirrors test_ws_decision_wire.py: read the source, isolate the catch
block inside handleChatSubmit, and assert key patterns.
