"""WebSocket Phase-1 — the SERVER half (browser ↔ FE, Hop 1).

One multiplexed WebSocket per canonical session, per ADR 0017 Phase 1 and the frozen wire spec
``docs/design/websocket-phase1-protocol.md``. It **swaps the pipe** under the proven consistency
model — it does not invent one. The load-bearing FE seams it re-hosts on the socket:

  * the ``hello``→``bind``→``ack`` handshake (§2) that binds + liveness-validates the canonical
    session BEFORE any subscribe — closing the #1085/#1086 window-collapse / reply-strip class by
    construction (a socket is never ``ack``-bound to a dead id, so no channel is ever subscribed to a
    404), reusing the EXACT existing helpers (``resolve_live_game_session`` / ``bind_game_session`` /
    ``_is_live_chat_session``); the resolution BRANCH is server-derived from authenticated engine
    state, never from anything the client sent (§2.2 forge guard);
  * the ``chat`` channel (§3) — a thin socket adapter over ``agent_runs.subscribe(canonicalId,
    from_seq)``: an ``ack{fromSeq, headSeq}`` first, then replay-from-``fromSeq`` → live-tail wrapped
    as ``event`` frames, gated on ``has_run`` (terminal-but-buffered still mirrors, ADR 0012), the
    reasoning split riding INSIDE the payload as a ``thinking`` flag (never a separate channel — the
    reasoning-scrub contract, ADR 0015);
  * the ``turn`` / ``decision`` up-frames (§3.5) relayed into the UNCHANGED ``agent_runs.start`` /
    engine path with the ``expectedBeatSeq`` compare-and-swap (0065) — a stale token ⇒ an ``error``
    frame ``{code:"stale-beat"}`` (the socket-native form of HTTP 409 ``stale-beat``), refused before
    any write;
  * the ``state`` / ``hud`` edge pings (§4) bridged from ``session_events`` — ids + ``beatSeq`` only,
    never a state body, so the Vault Wall stays trivially intact (the client re-reads its own
    Vault-free projection endpoint on the edge).

**Invariants (hard):** never a byte of Vault data crosses the socket (only the Vault-free projections
the SSE/poll surfaces already carry); every ``hello``/``bind``/``subscribe``/``turn``/``decision`` is
owner-guarded (cross-user isolation 0021 — one socket ↔ one user); reasoning rides inside the ``chat``
payload, never a second public channel; bind-before-subscribe.

The ``layout`` channel leg is now WIRED (#1293): it rides the same per-session ``session_events`` bus
and its per-device ``patch_layout(user, deviceId, …)`` re-key has merged, so ``_run_layout_channel`` /
``_handle_layout`` below are live (per-device LWW, ADR 0017 §5 — geometry is per-device, only game
state syncs). The route is registered but the client only ATTEMPTS the upgrade when the
``ORWELL_WS_TRANSPORT`` flag is on — **default off** in Phase 1 (owner-gated rollout), so nothing
ships to users from this PR alone; flipping it on is the separate turn-on step.
