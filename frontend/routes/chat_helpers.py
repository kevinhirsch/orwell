# between ceremonies. The owner's emphatic playtest verdict: "It should never fast forward… it skips
# all of the social narrative gameplay… zero social opportunity… a critical failure."
#
# The fix is PACING, not authoring (the engine still decides every outcome): after a ceremony lands
# the player in a NEW spectator beat, we DO NOT immediately drive the next one. We hold a SOCIAL
# RUNWAY of player turns — the player walks the house, talks, schemes, campaigns — and override the

# outcome is grounded, never invented) exactly as before, just no longer on the player's heels.
#
# Pacing is ENGAGEMENT, never a turn count (owner ruling): the runway is a CEILING on how long we
# wait — it is cut short the instant the player signals readiness, and a player who keeps engaging
# simply keeps lingering (the runway counts down only while the beat sits, and the cooldown re-arms
# on each fresh ceremony). It NEVER delays a beat the player must act on (a pending always advances

# `(week:phase)` signature, so no runway was armed, no moment changed, and the beat's content was
# simply lost — the model narrated straight past the night into the ceremony (the exact
# fast-forward the night-gate exists to prevent). Two repairs, both steer-based (never
# engine-authoring — the content voiced is the ENGINE's own `event.content`):
#   (a) the consumed beat arms a NARRATION STEER (the `_ceremony_narration_steer` sibling in the
#       agent loop) quoting the engine's transition line, appended to this turn's framing so the
#       model voices the night→morning crossing as a real beat;

# HARD-BLOCK the model: a forceful system directive that pins the model to THIS decision and
# forbids narrating any beat past it (no new day / ceremony / week / comp / eviction / time-skip).
# This is a prompt directive, not a UI change — the decision card already surfaces the pending,
# but the MODEL still narrates past it, so the error-correction belongs in the GM frame.

# decision. It cannot catch the OTHER class — a desync at an advanceGame-driven beat with NO
# pending, where the GM narrated an OUTCOME the engine never committed: "X is evicted" or
# crowning the finale winner a beat early, or misnarrating an eviction tally. Those slip past
# the barrier (no pending) AND the lull-nudge (rich prose, not a lull). So this is a second,
# AFTER-the-turn layer: snapshot the engine board before/after the turn, compare the turn's
# full narration against that delta, and when the narration ASSERTS an outcome the board did
# not move on, stash a forceful RE-GROUND directive to inject on the NEXT turn — pinning the
# model back to the engine as the source of truth before it digs the desync deeper.
#
# Conservative + field-specific by design: only a narrow set of outcome claims trips it, and
# each is checked against the exact signature field that would have moved had the outcome been
# real. The whole thing is best-effort / fail-open — it never breaks or blocks a turn.

# turn). The post-turn check diffs the post-turn signature against this. Process-local.

# path — `AUTH_ENABLED=false`, or any caller that never resolves a logged-in user — the FE chat route
# runs with `user=None`. Keying the baseline on `None` makes the guard EFFECTIVELY INERT: nothing
# distinguishes one turn's baseline from another's, and on a fresh process the baseline is simply
# absent so the pre-emission guard fails open on every turn (the #1045 live-drive finding — a
# fabricated running vote tally + a committed eviction streamed AHEAD of the engine commit, never
# held). The fix: when there is no `user`, key on the CANONICAL GAME-SESSION id instead (0064's
# per-user binding), so the guard has a stable per-game baseline single-tenant too.
#
# Cross-user isolation is UNWEAKENED by construction: a real user always has a truthy `user`, so it

# ── 0065 Part A/B — the per-turn LAST-SEEN beatSeq + compare-and-swap wiring ──────────────── #
#
# Part A (engine, commit e9c03b4) gives every read/advance/submit result a monotonic `beatSeq`, and
# lets the two PROGRESSION tools carry an optional `expectedBeatSeq` compare-and-swap token — a write
# computed against a board that has since moved (the 0064 queued-turn case) is REFUSED with HTTP 409
# `stale-beat` rather than applied to the moved board. Part B adds an `idempotencyKey` so a retried
# advance/submit returns the original result instead of double-advancing.
#
# The MODEL never sees these tokens — the FE holds them. This slice wires the FE-ISSUED progression
# calls (the C-02 pre-resolve here + the agent-loop forced/silent advance) to:
#   1. track the last-seen `beatSeq` per user (mirroring `_LAST_BEAT_SIG`), refreshed from EVERY
#      engine response that carries one (status/state reads AND every mutation's response — critical:
#      within one turn the FE makes multiple engine calls, each bumps `beatSeq`, so the last-seen
#      value MUST update from each response or the FE would inflict a SELF-409 on its own next call);
#   2. attach that last-seen token as `expected_beat_seq` + a freshly-minted `idempotency_key` to its
#      progression calls (the highest-value CAS point — the queued-turn case);
#   3. handle a 409 `stale-beat` gracefully — refresh last-seen, stash a re-ground via the EXISTING
#      desync mechanism (`_DESYNC_REGROUND`), and surface nothing scary to the player.
# Process-local (like `_LAST_BEAT_SIG`); a front-end restart simply re-seeds from the first read.
#
# NOW WIRED (the 0065 Part A tail): the lower-value FE-issued mutating tools also carry the CAS token.
# `recordInteraction` (the E22 fallback `ensure_turn_recorded` below; the `_auto_record_scene` belt),
# `makeDeal` (`_auto_record_deal`) and `moveTo` (`_auto_move_player`) — all in `src/agent_loop.py` —
# attach `expected_beat_seq=last_beat_seq(owner)` and refresh last-seen from EVERY response, so a
# normal multi-call turn never self-409s. These are re-derivable back-fills, not the double-apply
# case, so a stale 409 is reconciled-and-SKIPPED via `_handle_stale_beat` (never retried into a stomp,

# move a SECOND time under that very retry (audit CON-11, corroborating the standing R-A-S3 latent):
# the old behavior reconciled-and-GAVE UP, dropping the fold. For `recordInteraction`/`makeDeal`/the
# trust belts (confide/exposeSecret/tradeSecret) this back-fill is frequently the SCENE'S ONLY RECORD
# of a hidden relationship impact — dropping it silently evaporates real, already-happened play
# (mandate #4 / I4: "a novel move must never evaporate"). Rather than retry in a tight loop (a
# sustained two-window race could in principle keep moving the board every attempt — busy-retrying
# risks livelock), a second consecutive stale-409 on a fold-bearing call is DEFERRED into a tiny,
# bounded, per-owner queue and opportunistically retried the next time this owner issues ANY back-fill
# call — typically within the same turn or the very next one. The loss is bounded to LATENCY, not
# DATA: the fold still lands, just slightly late, and it can never double-apply (every drain attempt
# is itself CAS-guarded against the freshest `last_beat_seq` — a fresh stale-409 on the retry just
# re-queues it, never applies twice). In-process only (never persisted to disk — a restart re-derives
# from the next turn's live play, same as any other in-flight request), Vault-free (the payload is the

# ── 0076 — the PRESENCE / IDENTITY desync guard (the "reconcile" half) ─────────────────────── #
#
# The board desync check works because closed-set OUTCOMES (HOH/noms/veto/eviction) have crisp
# textual claim patterns. Presence claims in prose are diffuse ("Ana leans against the window"), so a
# scan can't safely EDIT live prose (that would risk gutting the storytelling the open set owns). This
# guard mirrors the board check's SAFE shape instead: post-turn, it stashes a GENTLE next-turn
# re-ground when the narration STAGES a houseguest AS ACTING in the player's scene whom the engine
# places off-scene. Closed-set only (who is where / who exists) — never the prose, never the open set.
#
# HIGH-PRECISION by construction (a false positive nags the model on a clean turn):
#   • flags ONLY a houseguest given an in-scene ACTION/SPEECH verb right after their name, who is

# weakening these verbs: `_stages_in_scene` masks a "possessive-name-owns-an-inanimate-object"
# construction before testing for staging (see `_INANIMATE_OWNED_NOUNS` below), so "Marcus Webb's

# ── NARR-3 (#613) — the INVENTED-HOUSEGUEST roster-validation backstop (post-turn re-ground) ──── #
#
# "EXACT names, never invent" is the moment prompt's "THE most important rule" — yet it was enforced by
# NOTHING structural (the closed-set outcome / evicted-location / wrong-nominee guards all assume a name
# that EXISTS in the roster; an INVENTED houseguest slips past all three). Houseguest invention is the
# single most immersion-shattering grounding break, and the moment runtime points at a tier the audit
# says invents cast — so this wires the missing structural backstop the issue asks for.
#
# It mirrors the presence guard's SAFE shape — a POST-TURN gentle re-ground, NOT a streamed scrub of
# prose (a false hold on creative prose is worse than a missed phantom; ADR 0005 #1). HIGH-PRECISION by
# construction, because creative prose is full of capitalized two-token phrases (Big Brother, Diary
# Room, Power of Veto, the Have-Not room, real-world references in banter):
#   • flags ONLY a Capitalized two-token name STAGED as acting/speaking in the scene (`_stages_in_scene`
#     — the same in-scene verb/quote binding the presence guard uses), so a bare mention or a place
#     name never matches;
#   • that is NEITHER an active NOR an out-of-house roster name (full-name OR first-name match, both
#     directions), AND whose first token is not a known game proper noun (Big/Diary/Power/Head/Have/
#     etc.) — a hard allowlist of the BB lexicon that would otherwise read as a two-token Name;
#   • SKIPS pre-game / casting and the finale (a juror name legitimately returns).
# A match only stashes a next-turn re-ground (never edits this turn's prose), so the worst case of a
# residual false positive is one gentle, ignorable nudge — never lost storytelling.

# Capitalized two-token sequences ("Marcus Webb", "Devon Hale") — the shape a houseguest full name
# takes in narration. Single capitalized tokens are deliberately NOT matched (far too many legitimate

# Ship-blocker A0: NPCs were narrated omniscient of the whole chat — one live playthrough had a
# houseguest recite the player's Diary-Room plan VERBATIM, though the Vault proved NO in-game pathway
# ever gave that houseguest the plan. The Diary Room is a player-level OOC channel with NO pathway to
# ANY houseguest (CLAUDE.md, "event/visibility model"); that is a structural Vault-Wall violation, not
# a narration-quality nit — while it holds, nothing the player says or plans is private and the social-
# deduction game has no floor.
#
# The engine already computes the correct per-NPC manifest (`npcVoice.knows`) and the always-sealed
# set (`sealedFromHouse` — the Diary-Room entries, `knownTo` empty). This is the DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
# post-hoc scan: before a line reaches the player, if a houseguest is STAGED voicing content sealed
# from them (a speaker not in that fact's `knownTo`), the sentence is DROPPED — mirroring the 0065
# pre-emission outcome guard's sentence-drop shape, never a new mechanism.

# Diary-Room class (`knownTo` empty ⇒ no houseguest may EVER voice it), and only when a distinctive
# multi-word shingle of the sealed content appears in a sentence where a houseguest is STAGED
# (`_stages_in_scene`). The player restating their OWN plan (no houseguest staged) is never touched;
# the diary-room BEAT itself (no houseguest present) is never touched. Non-diary player secrets are

# touches CLOSED-SET BOARD CLAIMS ONLY. It reuses `_narration_claims_outcome`'s exact detectors +
# phase-gating — it invents NO broader matching, and it must NEVER hold, drop, or rewrite creative /
# social prose. A false hold on creative prose is worse than a missed phantom, so:

#   • UNCERTAIN (no before-signature this turn, or the live board read hiccups) ⇒ EMIT (fall through
#     to the post-turn re-ground). Conservatism is mandatory.

# The cheap, synchronous PRE-FILTER: does this sentence even contain closed-set OUTCOME language? This
# is the only thing that runs on every streamed sentence — it short-circuits the live-board read (and

# The pre-emission guards above (`screen_streamed_outcome` / `screen_streamed_scene_break`) DROP a
# phantom sentence/scene mid-stream and lean on the NEXT-turn `_DESYNC_REGROUND` as the correction; the
# S2b fail-closed judge ALSO only QUEUES a next-turn re-ground. So a closed-set fabrication the mid-
# stream guards miss — the captured **msg53** "Jasmine wins Head of Household!" narrated in `premiere`
# with `toolsCalled:[]` — still reaches the player THAT turn: `_narration_claims_outcome` is phase-gated
# (an HOH crown outside an `hoh` phase is treated as flavor), so the scene never broke. The owner's
# ruling is that the overseer must CORRECT the moment IN-BAND, this turn — not merely re-ground the next.
#
# `enforce_grounded_draft` is that mechanism. Given the finalized draft + the tools the turn actually
# called, when the draft asserts a CLOSED-SET outcome the live board does NOT back AND no PROGRESSION
# tool fired (`advanceGame`/`submitDecision` — the ONLY way a closed-set outcome commits) it:
#   1. BLOCKS the draft (the fabrication is never the final word),
#   2. re-prompts the model ONCE with a corrective wire (via the caller's `regenerate` callback), and
#   3. if the regenerated draft is STILL ungrounded (or no `regenerate` is available), returns a

# (premiere-class) phases where an HOH/nom/veto/eviction/winner is IMPOSSIBLE by construction — so
# creative/social prose is never touched. When a PROGRESSION tool DID fire (the board may legitimately
# hold the outcome) the guard STANDS DOWN — a grounded outcome is NEVER re-blocked (the before/after
# identity guards own that case). Fail-open: any hiccup returns the draft unchanged (`action="pass"`).

# ── ADR 0009 (D3 Part B) — the PRE-EMISSION LOCATION guard (evicted-houseguest-in-a-room) ──────── #
#
# The location counterpart of the closed-set guard above. The PO's overriding constraint (2026-06-21)
# is NO visible historic conflict between the prose and the board. A legal narrated MOVE is hard-folded
# into the board (the D2 `_auto_move_npc`/`moveHouseguest` path), so it is never a conflict. The
# residual IMPOSSIBLE claim is "a houseguest who has LEFT the house (evicted, or now on the jury) is
# back in a room" — that can never be folded into a legal state, so it must be caught BEFORE the player
# sees it (never a later-turn correction, which would leave the conflict visible in the transcript).
#
# Scope is DELIBERATELY narrow (the conservatism mandate — a false hold on creative prose is worse than
# a missed phantom, ADR 0005 #1). The other two impossibility classes from the ruling are handled
# WITHOUT a scrub, to protect creative prose: a NON-EXISTENT room and TWO-PLACES-AT-ONCE are grounded
# at the source by the D3-Part-A location barrier (and an invented room is refused by the engine belt,
# never folded) — aggressively regex-scrubbing them would risk holding legitimate loose room
# description / sequential movement (which the hard-fold makes legal). The evicted-in-a-room claim is
# both unambiguously impossible AND reliably detectable, so it is the one we scrub.
#
# Reliability: we fire ONLY when an out-of-house NAME is bound (within a tight window) to present-tense
# IN-SCENE presence language AND a real HOUSE ROOM is named in the sentence. That triple gate keeps
# the legitimate cases safe: "X was evicted" (no room, no present verb), "X heads to the jury house"
# (no house room), "I miss X; the kitchen isn't the same" (name not bound to a presence verb), and any
# past-tense reminiscing all EMIT untouched. Finale phases are skipped entirely (jurors legitimately
# reappear to vote, 0037). The evicted NAMES come from the cached turn-start signature — no per-sentence
# engine fetch.

# Present-tense, in-scene presence/entrance language. Bare copulas ("is"/"are") are DELIBERATELY
# excluded — "X is on the jury" / "X is gone" are legitimate — so only active entrance/occupancy verbs
# qualify, and only when also bound to a house room (below).

    outcome — but ONLY after the player has had their SOCIAL RUNWAY in the current beat (the
    force-march fix above). Returns the (possibly re-fetched / social-overridden) game state.
    Best-effort: any hiccup leaves the turn exactly as it was — this never blocks or fails a turn,
    it only prevents an invented/stalled beat OR a fast-forward past the player's social play.

    Covers the intent-free CEREMONIES (nominations, veto ceremony, eviction reveal) AND the
    COMPETITIONS (hoh-competition, veto-competition incl. the chip draw) — owner ruling 2026-06-18:
    the engine makes every game decision. A comp advance either SURFACES the player's comp-intent
    (player in the field) or RESOLVES an NPC-only comp; either way the engine decides, not the model.

    Safety: advanceGame auto-resolves NPC beats but only SURFACES a player decision as a pending —
    it never auto-decides one. We still check the pending first and skip when the player is the
    decider (HOH naming noms, veto holder, an eligible voter, the Houseguest's-Choice picker, a
    comp-intent), so the player keeps their agency and their decision card. One advance per turn
    preserves the staged eviction-vote reveal (E12).

    The SOCIAL RUNWAY (the never-fast-forward fix): when a held runway is still counting down for the
    current `(week:phase)` AND the player has not signalled readiness, we HOLD — override the moment
    to `social` and do NOT advance, so the player walks the house and schemes before the next
    ceremony. When the runway is spent (or the player asks to move on), we resolve the next ceremony
    for real and, if it landed the player in a NEW spectator beat, arm a fresh runway for it."""

    is always wrong — the bug class where a fresh player says "hi" and meets a generic chatbot):

      • engine unreachable  → FEED_DOWN_PROMPT, fail-CLOSED — regardless of `_GAME_WAS_ACTIVE`
        (that marker only narrows the non-game build, where plain chat is a legitimate surface).

    Incognito strips framing ONLY when the game build is off (E24/P7): under the game build,
    "Nobody" must not become an unframed, unrecorded imitation-play channel — the route already
    forces the flag off, and this guard holds even for direct callers.

    stores) instead of zero history.

    Returns (engine_available, game_active, feed_down):
      engine_available — engine answered get_game_state (game or no game); triggers game-tool
        pinning so the model can always call createCharacter / getGameState.
      game_active — a game is started; an in-character system prompt was prepended so the turn
        speaks in-character, and the agent route auto-escalates.

    converges its view — yet the turn persists under its per-tab session. Keying the run on a foreign

    session on settle (``canonical_session`` event → selectSession) and reload a history that does NOT
    contain the just-streamed reply — the casting AI bubble VANISHED (A_count 2→1). Restricting the
    canonical key to a live game keeps casting strictly per-tab: run key, persistence, and the FE view
