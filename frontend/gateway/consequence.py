"""Gateway consequence fold — the multi-platform gateway's counterpart to the streaming agent
loop's 0055 ``_auto_record_scene`` belt (2026-07-22 repo gap audit, finding G1).

THE BUG THIS CLOSES. Every player turn taken through the gateway (feature 0072 — Telegram/Discord
etc., ``gateway/handler.py::_call_player_turn``) called only READ engine tools
(``getGameState``/``getMomentPrompt``), narrated, and returned — never ``recordInteraction``, never
any other mutating tool. That silently bypassed the whole consequence/memory loop (mandate #4 /
feature 0023, "never ship an action that is narrated but never recorded") for an entire live client
surface, AND — because ``recordInteraction`` is the ONLY mutating call in this path — meant
``Orchestrator.commitPlayerTurn``'s per-turn bounded off-screen tick (the seam every mutating tool
rides via ``EngineCommandsAdapter``'s ``onPersist`` → ``registry.commit`` →
``orchestrator.commitPlayerTurn``, wired in ``src/composition/runtime.ts``'s
``registry.setCommit(...)``) never fired either, freezing the off-screen society for gateway-only
players.

THE FIX. ``handler.py`` calls :func:`fold_gateway_turn` once, after narration, with the player's raw
message + the narrated reply + the live house roster. It is a deliberately self-contained MIRROR of
``_auto_record_scene``'s contract — it does NOT import ``frontend/src/agent_loop.py`` (locked
tonight, and importing the full streaming agent loop is exactly the weight the 0072 design
deliberately avoids for this lightweight HTTP-turn path):

  1. A constrained extraction call over the user's resolved UTILITY model, when one resolves,
     proposing ``{withIds, kind, content}`` — model-proposed SHAPE only (ADR 0005: direction/
     participants/kind), never a magnitude; the engine alone decides how far anything moves.
  2. Failing that (no model configured, or the extraction call/parse fails), a DETERMINISTIC FLOOR:
     a kind-less ``recordInteraction`` naming whichever houseguests the turn's own text actually
     names, intersected with the engine's own live presence read when available — never invented.

Witness-set discipline (E21/BL-014 in ``EngineCommandsAdapter.recordInteraction``): the engine
itself is the final authority on who witnessed what — this module only PROPOSES a witness set, and
proposes the MINIMAL SAFE one it can derive from real turn context, never a guess.

Fail-soft, never SILENT (#1599): every genuine failure here is WARN-logged AND recorded via
``log_rings.record_soft_failure`` (RED-eligible on ``/admin/status`` — a correction is not a cloak).
A turn with nothing recordable (a solo/idle beat, non-diegetic text) is not a failure and returns
``False`` without any record.
