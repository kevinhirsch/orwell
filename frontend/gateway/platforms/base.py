"""Platform adapter base class for the multi-platform gateway (feature 0072).

Adapted from hermes-agent gateway/platforms/base.py
(MIT © 2025 Nous Research — see frontend/ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md).

Each concrete adapter:
  1. Declares a unique ``platform_id`` (e.g. ``"telegram"``)
  2. Implements :meth:`send` to deliver a reply to a platform user
  3. Implements :meth:`parse_inbound` to normalise an inbound webhook payload
     into a ``(platform_identity, text)`` tuple

Adding a platform is a two-file change: a new adapter module + an import that
triggers self-registration.  Core routing never changes.

        The webhook trusts the client-supplied platform identity as its credential, so
        without transport auth anyone who can reach the public URL can forge a turn for a
        paired user. This hook lets an adapter verify a platform signature/secret header.

        Default: ``True`` — **opt-in** verification, so an adapter (or deployment) with no
        secret configured behaves exactly as before. A concrete adapter that HAS a secret
        configured compares it (constant-time) against the platform's signature header and
        returns ``False`` on mismatch. *headers* is a case-insensitive mapping
