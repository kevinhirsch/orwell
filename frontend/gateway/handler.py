"""Gateway turn handler for the multi-platform gateway (feature 0072).

Routes an inbound platform message to the player's game over the existing Vault-free
MCP player channel (src.orwell_engine), then scrubs the reply before delivery.

The game-build flag is always ON for the gateway — platform players reach only the
keep-set game tools; inherited-workspace tools (the drop-set) are unavailable by
construction (the engine player channel never exposes them).

Architecture note: this module calls :mod:`src.orwell_engine` directly, the same
thin async HTTP client the web FE uses.  It does NOT import any TS port or Vault
adapter — Vault-safe by inheritance.
