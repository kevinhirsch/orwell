"""The rendered a11y gate (Stream S / ruling #16 — #651 gap 3, issue #1375).

A sibling of `responsive_matrix.py` that reuses its ENGINE-STAGED matrix
(`ORWELL_MATRIX_ENGINE` / `ORWELL_MATRIX_FINISH=1` staging — chrome + game +
endgame surfaces) and, instead of measuring geometry, asserts two RENDERED
accessibility invariants the source-pinned Python checks cannot see:

  axe      — inject axe-core into each staged surface and run it; FAIL on any
             WCAG level-A / level-AA violation and any ARIA-category violation
             (axe's own `color-contrast` rule is DISABLED here — contrast is
             owned by the sweep below so the two concerns never double-count).
  contrast — a RENDERED WCAG (4.5:1 / 3:1) + APCA(Lc) sweep. It does NOT try to
             composite the CSS box stack (this app paints its themed backdrop
             from FIXED sibling layers — body/html are transparent — so an
             ancestor composite is structurally wrong). Instead it screenshots
             each state with all text made transparent, then samples the TRUE
             rendered backdrop pixels behind every text run: glass, scrims,
             backdrop-filter blur and images are all included exactly as painted
             — the "computed glass/scrim contrast the source-pinned checks can't
             see." APCA Lc rides along for the polarity-aware read #738 works in.
             Text over a NON-UNIFORM backdrop (a busy photo/portrait) is reported
             INDETERMINATE and never hard-gated (its contrast is a judgment call).

KNOWN violations carry a finding ID in XFAIL below and report as xfail (exit 0).
When a finding LANDS, its xfail flips to a hard assertion by REMOVING the entry —
the gate ratchets. An xpass (an XFAIL id that never fired) prints a nudge to
remove the stale entry. Any UNKNOWN violation FAILS the gate. Never silent.

Findings are DEDUPED by a stable needle across viewports/sub-passes: an axe rule
and a computed-contrast element are viewport-invariant (the rule fires on the
same DOM; a color/size failure is theme-driven, not width-driven), so one unique
violation reports once no matter how many tiers hit it. That keeps the registry
small and the ratchet honest.

Engine-staged surfaces are exercised when an engine is reachable
(ORWELL_MATRIX_ENGINE=url); otherwise the run covers the page chrome (composer,
sidebar, settings, onboarding) — still the a11y regression net. CI runs it
ENGINE-STAGED with ORWELL_MATRIX_FINISH=1 (mirroring the fe-responsive job) so
the game + endgame surfaces are audited on every FE PR. axe-core is VENDORED at
`frontend/tests/vendor/axe.min.js` (npm `axe-core`; injected via Playwright with
a bypass-CSP test context — no network, no CDN) so the gate is hermetic. Usage:

# finding-id → the substring the failure LINE must contain (same shape as responsive_matrix.py's
# XFAIL). A finding LINE that contains the needle reports xfail (exit 0) instead of failing the
# gate. Each entry is a KNOWN, pre-existing violation on main; issue #1375 tracks the batch and the
# lead files each as its OWN issue (swap the placeholder id for the real one). REMOVE an entry the
# moment its violation is fixed — the gate then ratchets that family to a hard assertion. An xpass

# a surface that doesn't render in a given run (e.g. an engine-less chrome-only run) is harmless.
