"""The responsive matrix gate (Stream S, mechanism part 5 — ruling #16).

Boots the real front-end (and, when available, the real engine with a staged
game) and drives the UI across the viewport matrix with MEASURABLE assertions:

  overflow  — no page-level horizontal scroll; no surface wider than its box
  overlap   — no registered game surface intersects another or the composer
              (the D2 collision rule, executable)
  crowding  — no visible text below the --fs-2xs floor (~11px); no nowrap
              line-box overflow
  touch     — ≥44px interactive boxes at coarse-pointer viewports (WCAG 2.5.5)
  200% pass — doubling the root font must not break the page

KNOWN failures carry a finding ID in XFAIL below and report as xfail (exit 0).
When a finding lands, its xfail flips to a hard assertion by REMOVING the entry
— the gate ratchets. An xpass prints a nudge to remove the entry.

Engine-staged surfaces (status HUD, decision card, …) are exercised when an
engine is reachable (ORWELL_MATRIX_ENGINE=url) or buildable; otherwise the run
covers the page chrome (composer, sidebar, settings, theme modal) — still the
S1/S5/S9 regression net. CI's fe-responsive job runs ENGINE-STAGED with
ORWELL_MATRIX_FINISH=1 (#651 gap 1), so the game + endgame surfaces are
measured on every FE PR. Usage:  python3 scripts/responsive_matrix.py

J5-19 — the ENDGAME mobile sweep (opt-in). stage_game() only creates a fresh
(turn-0) game, so the endgame surfaces (#orwell-retro self-gates on
recap.finished; the endgame decision card needs a live finale pending) never
render under the default run — leaving the endgame mobile UX asserted by
source-string tests only. Set ORWELL_MATRIX_FINISH=1 (with a reachable engine)
to fast-forward the staged season to FINISHED via the engine's player-channel
advanceGame/submitDecision loop, then mount #orwell-retro + the endgame decision
card and re-run the SAME overlap/tap/crowding sweep at the phone tiers. It is
guarded (off by default; no-op without an engine or a started game) and fail-
soft, so it can never change the default fresh-game run.
