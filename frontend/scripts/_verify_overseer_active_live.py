"""#766 — the owed LIVE-model validation of the 0080 ACTIVE runtime overseer.

The `active` overseer dispatch path is **live-only by design** (feature 0080 ruling D4): the
seeded / stubbed test lanes never resolve a real model, so the `DeterministicOverseer` stub is
wired and the inline heuristic guardrails stay the actor — no automated gate ever exercises the
reasoning tier *acting on its own verdict*. #766 is exactly that gap. This driver is the standing
evidence run: it boots a production-shaped stack, wires a REAL utility model (so
`overseer.LlmOverseer` resolves through `_resolve_llm_fn`), forces `overseer_mode=active`, drives a
real-model game walk long enough to trip the sparse 0079 symptom gate, and asserts the active
overseer FIRED, DISPATCHED a lever with its intended effect, LOGGED it truthfully, leaked no Vault,
and DEGRADES SOFT under a real model.

It is the driver the `live-harness-nightly.yml` **overseer-live** leg auto-runs (it runs the script
iff present and uploads `frontend/data/_overseer_live/` as evidence). Full validation needs the
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` repo secret; without a key the script prints the FAIL line and exits 1.

Fork lineage: this reuses the boot / model-wiring / teardown scaffolding of
`scripts/_verify_two_window_live.py` verbatim; only what it drives and asserts differs. It drives
via HTTP turns (no Playwright needed — the evidence is the Vault-free OVERSEER ring + the divergence
ledger, read over the admin log API, not the DOM).

Roles only in output — no houseguest / player names (CLAUDE.md testing rule): the player is created
as "Player", pending options are answered generically without echoing the option labels, and the
printed / persisted evidence refers to nominees as roles.

Usage:
    cd frontend && OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-... .venv/bin/python3 scripts/_verify_overseer_active_live.py

Writes evidence (per-assessment table, the OVERSEER-ring + divergence-ledger dump, a PASS/FAIL
summary) under data/_overseer_live/. Exit 0 on all-pass, 1 otherwise.
