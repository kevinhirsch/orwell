"""Front-end store reset to exact OOBE — preserving ONLY the API-key / LLM-provider config.

This is the FE-store half of ``deploy/orwell-oobe-reset.sh`` (the "keep API keys" tier).
It returns the front-end data dir to a first-run state — clearing ALL accounts, chats,
sessions, memory, MCP server configs, uploads, portraits, and every user setting — while
PRESERVING exactly the configuration an operator should never have to re-enter: the
configured LLM/image providers and the keys that decrypt them.

What "API-key / LLM-provider config" means here (and where it lives):

  * ``app.db`` → table ``model_endpoints`` — the admin-configured providers: each row's
    ``base_url``, the (Fernet-encrypted) ``api_key``, model pools, image vs llm type, etc.
    This is the PRIMARY provider config in the modern build (src/endpoint_resolver.py).
  * ``data/settings.json`` → the model SELECTION keys are RESET to the OOB defaults
    (issue #860): a reset does NOT carry the previously-selected models — only operational flags
    (image_gen_enabled, image_quality, vision_enabled) survive. After the reset the defaults stand
    (narrator z-ai/glm-4.7 + utility qwen/qwen3.6-27b on OpenRouter — the ADR 0016 pair, narrator
    per the 2026-07-13 owner ruling; portrait google/gemini-3.1-flash-image). The default-ENDPOINT
    DESIGNATION (``default_endpoint_id``) is PRESERVED (2026-07-12 PROD-blocker fix): it is
    validated against the carried rows and re-pointed at the sole enabled+keyed endpoint when it
    was empty/dangling — the per-call-class resolver never had a "bind empty default to the first
    enabled endpoint" behavior, so dropping the designation bricked game creation under the strict
    0116 enrichment policy. Preserved endpoint rows are also RE-OWNED to shared (owner=NULL),
    because the reset wipes every account and a stale owner stamp fails the resolver's scoping.
  * ``data/.app_key`` → the Fernet key that decrypts ``model_endpoints.api_key`` (and the
    other EncryptedText columns). Preserving the endpoints WITHOUT this key would leave the
    stored keys permanently undecryptable, so it is preserved as a FILE (see the shell
    script's keep-list) and read here only to validate round-trips.
  * ``data/api_keys.json`` + ``data/.key`` → the legacy ``APIKeyManager`` provider keys.
    Preserved as FILES by the shell script's keep-list (not touched here).

Everything else in ``app.db`` (accounts live in ``data/auth.json``, not the DB; sessions,
chat_messages, memories, mcp_servers, documents, gallery, tasks, crew, …) is DROPPED: this
script rebuilds the SQLite file from scratch carrying ONLY the preserved ``model_endpoints``
rows, so no stray user data can survive a column we forgot to enumerate.

Design notes:
  * Operates on the SQLite file directly via the stdlib ``sqlite3`` — NO SQLAlchemy / ``core``
    import chain — so it runs in the bare deploy/CI env and is trivially unit-testable.
  * Idempotent + safe to re-run: a second run on an already-OOBE store is a clean no-op
    (no endpoints to carry, fresh empty DB) and never raises on a missing file.
  * Paths come from env (``DATA_DIR`` / ``DATABASE_URL``) exactly like the app, so a test
    points it at a temp dir; defaults match the app (``<frontend>/data``).
  * NEVER touches ``data/.env`` (the engine EnvironmentFile) — that file is the shell
    script's concern and lives in the ENGINE config dir, not the FE store.

# Reset semantics (issue #860, owner ruling 2026-06-25; amended 2026-07-12): a factory/OOBE reset
# preserves ONLY the API key(s) + the provider endpoint record(s) (the model_endpoints rows, carried
# separately) — it does NOT preserve the SELECTED MODELS. After a reset the model selections revert
# to the OOB defaults (narrator z-ai/glm-4.7 + utility qwen/qwen3.6-27b on OpenRouter — the ADR
# 0016 pair, narrator per the 2026-07-13 owner ruling; portrait google/gemini-3.1-flash-image), so a
# stale/placeholder pick (e.g. the "sakana/fugu-ultra" the owner was stuck on) can never ride across
# a reset.
#
# 2026-07-12 (PROD blocker): the default-ENDPOINT DESIGNATION (`default_endpoint_id`) is NOT a model
# selection and IS preserved. This module's earlier claim that "resolution binds the empty default
# endpoint to the first enabled endpoint" was FALSE for the per-call-class utility resolution
# (`src/endpoint_resolver.resolve_endpoint` had no such binding), so dropping the designation
# bricked game creation under the strict 0116 enrichment policy ("no model resolved for the
# cast-genesis/-identity/-authoring call class") until an operator re-picked a default by hand.
# The designation is preserved when it points at a surviving row, re-pointed at the sole surviving
# enabled+keyed LLM endpoint when it was empty/dangling, and dropped only when genuinely ambiguous
# (2+ candidates — the runtime single-endpoint auto-default in endpoint_resolver stays the belt).
