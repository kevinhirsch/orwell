// OrwellWindow — THE window kit (Lane F / F-1; DWE audit Phase 2).
//
// One base class + one CSS family (.ow-window / .ow-titlebar / .ow-controls /
// .ow-body + state modifiers) that every panel, modal, and popover composes —
// replacing the per-panel reimplementations the 2026-06-11 DWE audit censused
// (3 drag engines, 7 geometry-key schemes, 6 chrome builders, 5+ Escape paths,
// 2 z escalators). The kit OWNS, in one place:
//
//   • registration: OrwellSlots (placement) + modalManager (minimize/dock chip)
//   • drag (windowDrag) with an EXPLICIT clamp — never trust cursor physics
//   • one z-authority for the window band (modals stay above; banner above all)
//     + click-to-front + a visible focused state (audit F9)
//   • minimize-to-dock with the ruling-#19 fly-out toward the dock and a
//     fly-away on close; restore mirrors minimize with a fly-IN from the dock,
//     and open keeps the E97 fade+scale (open↔close and minimize↔restore are
//     mirror-image motions); prefers-reduced-motion strips ALL of it (audit F4)
//   • ONE geometry-persistence scheme: the slot offset, clamped at restore
//     (S11/E91) — kit windows never mint their own position keys (audit F5)
//   • focus management: focus-return to the opener on close (audit F8),
//     keyboard move on the titlebar — arrows move, Shift+arrows resize where
//     enabled, Home re-docks to the slot base (audit F10)
//   • Escape participation through ui.js's single arbiter (audit F7): menus
//     dismiss first, then the top kit window parks/closes, then modals
//   • teardown: one AbortController; destroy() leaves no listeners, no node
//
// Migration waves (Lane F / F-2) move each existing surface onto this class
// and DELETE its bespoke code in the same PR. New windows MUST compose the kit
// (the F-3 ratchet pins it).

// lingering windows. This is exactly the "per-window `modal` option" the UX audit
// deferred J1-25 to (UX-AUDIT-LOG.md:191): the cast-photo dialog let focus escape into
// the chat and floated over live narration with no scrim. It sits at the modal tier
// (the legacy .modal family is 1000+): the scrim just under, the window just above, so
// a modal kit window clears the kit band (500-980) AND its own scrim.

// ── #870: the modal STACK manager (modal-over-modal coordination) ───────────
// A single modal was correct (J1-25/J1-23: scrim + inert + focus-trap + aria-modal).
// The gap (#870, a P1 lockup): two LIVE modals at once. The onboarding "Production
// needs the feeds" window is modal:true; its "Choose models" opens Settings, ALSO
// modal:true — so two modals were mounted together. Each one independently (1) inerted
// EVERY body child except its own el + scrim (so modal A inerted modal B → B is dead),
// and (2) drew a scrim at a shared fixed z — A's scrim could sit at/over B. Result:
// the second modal renders stacked/dimmed and is non-interactive (the lockup).
//
// The fix is ONE ordered modal stack the kit owns (bottom → top). On open a modal
// PUSHES; on close it POPS. From the stack we recompute, top-down:
//   • z: each modal's window draws a fresh monotonic modal z (via the single OrwellZ
//     authority), and its scrim sits one below — so a later modal is STRICTLY above an
//     earlier one (window + scrim both). No shared fixed z.
//   • inert: only the TOP modal is interactive. The page AND every lower modal go inert;
//     the top modal + its own scrim stay live. Inert is recomputed from the CURRENT top
//     on every push/pop, and each modal remembers ONLY the nodes IT set inert, so a pop
//     never un-inerts a node the new top still needs inert.
//   • focus: only the top modal traps focus; closing returns focus to the previous top.
// Single-modal behavior is byte-equivalent: with one modal the stack has one entry, the
// recompute inerts exactly "every body child except el + scrim" (the old all-or-nothing),
// the scrim/z land where they used to, and teardown un-inerts that same set.
const _modalStack = [];   // live modal OrwellWindow instances, bottom → top
// The exact set of nodes the kit has currently forced inert for the modal stack. Tracked
// HERE (not per-modal) so the inert state is always recomputed from the live TOP — a pop
// can never un-inert a node a lower modal still needs inert, because we recompute the whole
// set from scratch against the new top each time. Only nodes the kit itself set inert are
// ever released (a node that was already inert for another reason is left untouched).

// ── #925: orphaned-scrim sweep (the modal scrim is the kit's exclusive node) ─
// A modal mounts a full-viewport backdrop `.ow-scrim` ([data-ow-scrim="<id>"]) in
// _mountModalChrome and removes it in _unmountModalChrome. The reported lockup (#925):
// a scrim can be left behind — its window torn down by a path that bypassed the kit's
// teardown, or a same-id modal collision desyncing the manager registry — and a lingering
// full-viewport scrim intercepts ALL pointer events, so the Settings gear and other modals
// become unclickable. The two flaky FE gates (test_h2b_all_model_pools /
// test_h2h3_settings) hit this: their converging dismiss+click loop can never converge while
// a scrim outlives its window.
//
// The kit creates scrims in EXACTLY one place (_mountModalChrome), one per modal instance, so
// a scrim is LEGITIMATE only while its owning modal is still a live stack entry. This sweep
// removes any `.ow-scrim` that is NOT the `_scrim` of a modal currently in _modalStack whose
// window element is still connected to the DOM — i.e. a genuinely orphaned scrim, never a live
// modal's. It is a no-op in the normal single-modal case (the one live scrim is kept). Called

         max-width: 64vw with no mobile override — CSS's abs-pos over-constraint

         edge (theme picker: zero visible swatches; every other window: the same
