// Orwell failure ring, browser side (Lane G11) — the standard sink for fail-open catches.
//
// The house style for user-facing feature failure is fail-OPEN: the panel simply isn't
// there, the chip doesn't render, the portrait stays a placeholder. Correct UX —
// structurally SILENT: every failure renders as absence, and nobody learns anything
// (the image-gen complaint, generalized). This module fixes the silence WITHOUT
// changing the UX: a fail-open catch adds ONE line — OrwellReport.fail(surface,
// errorClass, detail) — and the failure lands in the G1b LIVE ring (POST
// /api/orwell/fe-report → logger.info("[fe-fail] …")), visible on /admin/status.
//
// Contract: throttled client-side (max ~10/min), rate-limited server-side, and it
// NEVER throws — reporting a failure must never become one. Loaded as a plain
// script BEFORE the orwell panels, so window.OrwellReport exists when they run;
// call sites still guard (`window.OrwellReport && …`) in case this file 404s.

  // failures — they should not log as noise at INFO. We tag a report as `startup` when it
  // is a network "Failed to fetch" AND we have NOT yet had a confirmed engine contact
  // (latched by markConnected on the first successful poll) AND we are still inside the
