/**
 * #1414 (R3 PR6): the SEND-OUTBOX subsystem — the reload-durable, session-bound, self-continuing
 * queue for messages a player sends while a turn streams / while offline (#985 P2-A / #891 / #830).
 *
 * The next extraction from the chat.js god-object (docs/REFACTOR-ROADMAP.md, R3), building on PR0
 * (chatState.js) + PR1 (chatScrollEdges) + PR2 (chatSubmitButton) + PR3 (chatAttachments) + PR4
 * (chatWsSplice) + PR5 (chatMessageActions). Moved VERBATIM from chat.js — behavior-preserving, no
 * logic change (the 2-space indentation is kept exactly so the source-pin gates slice unchanged):
 *   - _enqueueSend / _paintOutboxBubble — queue a send + paint its optimistic pending bubble.
 *   - _persistOutbox / _restoreOutboxFromStorage / _outboxPeekStorage — the sessionStorage (per-tab)
 *       durability layer + boot restore.
 *   - _outboxConfirmDelivery / _requeueOutboxItem / _isNetworkSendFailure / _dedupeOutboxAgainstServer
 *       — the delivery-confirm, network-requeue, and at-most-once (pre-send server-log) seams.
 *   - _setQueuedTag / _refreshOutboxStatusTags / _setDeliveryState / _clearDeliveryRetry /
 *       _attachDeliveryRetry — the honest per-bubble delivery-state chrome (#891 P0-2 / F-A7).
 *   - _markSendFailed / _markSendFailedById / _retryFailedSend — the durable terminally-failed bucket.
 *   - _updateOutboxStrip — the #830 aggregate above-composer notice-kit projection.
 *   - _armOutboxRetry / _foldOutboxBatch / _flushSendOutbox — the capped-backoff retry, the
 *       rapid-succession fold, and the FIFO drain itself.
 *   - the boot-restore durability wiring (online/offline/pageshow listeners) — a module-level side
 *       effect that runs once at eval (chat.js imports this module exactly once, #1399).
 *
 * The three outbox queues (`_sendOutbox` / `_outboxAwaitingConfirm` / `_outboxFailed`) and the two
 * single-flight guards (`_flushingOutbox` / `_outboxRestoreDone`) live on the shared `chatState`
 * singleton (PR0) — read/written as `chatState.X` here exactly as in chat.js, so the submit path
 * (chat.js), the drain (here), and the reconcile (chat.js) all serialize on ONE instance.
 *
 * Coupling: two chat.js-internal deps.
 *   - handleChatSubmit — the flush's dispatch. It STAYS in chat.js (the turn orchestrator + stream
 *     loop); importing it here would be a circular edge, so chat.js registers the SOLE production
 *     dispatch — a headless `handleChatSubmit(null, text, opts)`, byte-identical to the pre-PR6
 *     default — through the `_setOutboxDispatch` seam at module-eval. `_setOutboxDispatch` is also the
 *     browser-gate spy hook (it swaps `_outboxDispatch` for a stub); production and test both route
 *     through it, last-writer-wins (production registers at eval; a test overrides afterward).
 *   - API_BASE — a chat.js `let` set once in init(). Injected as a `() => API_BASE` resolver via
 *     `_setOutboxDeps`, read live inside `_dedupeOutboxAgainstServer` (the PR3/PR5 apiBase pattern).
 * Everything else the subsystem touches is importable (chatRenderer / ui / sessions / chatState) or a
 * global (window.OrwellNoticeKit, window._orwellComposerDraftClear, sessionStorage, navigator, fetch).
 *
 * Public API preserved: chat.js imports every moved function and re-exports the browser-gate ones on
 * the `chatModule` object byte-identically (`_enqueueSend`, `_flushSendOutbox`, `_setOutboxDispatch`,
 * `_restoreOutboxFromStorage`, `_outboxConfirmDelivery`, `_setDeliveryState`, `_markSendFailedById`,
 * `_retryFailedSend`, `_requeueOutboxItem`, `_persistOutbox`, `_dedupeOutboxAgainstServer`,
 * `_isNetworkSendFailure`, `_outboxPeekStorage`, `_updateOutboxStrip`), plus the three chatState-backed
 * arrays. sessions.js's selectSession nudge (`window.chatModule._flushSendOutbox`) keeps working
 * through that re-export.
 *
 * Dual-load idempotent (#1399 generalized): the module-level state is either chatState-backed (one
 * shared instance) or a transient flush timer / notice handle; the durability listeners are added once
 * because chat.js imports this module exactly once. Imported BY chat.js only (never app.js / an html
 * shell), so #1399 single-eval holds.

  // ── #985 P2-A: the SEND OUTBOX ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  // A message the player sends WHILE a turn is streaming must NOT be silently dropped (the old
  // `isStreaming → Stop` branch aborted the reply and `return`ed before the new text was ever read).
  // The owner's ruling was "Queue it": enqueue the new message into this in-memory FIFO, paint its
  // optimistic bubble immediately (composes with #992 render-by-seq — a pending bubble carries a
  // clientMsgId, NO dbId/seq, so it floats to the tail until its seq lands), clear the composer (the
  // text is now safely captured here, not lost), and flush the queue IN ORDER the moment the current
  // turn settles — one in flight at a time, mirroring the engine's server-side `_framed` serialization.
  // Idempotent + multibrowser-safe: each item is keyed by its `clientMsgId`, which the existing
  // optimistic-adopt path reconciles by, so a flush is at-most-once and reconciles cleanly across
  // windows (sends target the canonical session per #990, render by seq per #992, mirror per #991).
  // Items: { clientMsgId, text, bubbleEl }. STOP is reserved for the explicit Stop button / an EMPTY
  // composer — "stop the current reply" and "send a new message" are no longer collapsed onto one
  // silent action.
  // chatState._sendOutbox is this in-memory FIFO; chatState._flushingOutbox is the single-flight
  // re-entrancy guard (only one flush send dispatched at a time). Moved to chatState.js, #1414 R3 PR0.

  // ── #891 P0 (messaging resilience): the RELOAD-DURABLE half of the outbox + honest offline status ──
  // The #985 outbox above was in-memory only — a hard reload while a send sat QUEUED lost it (the
  // explicitly-deferred half; audit row INT-3). Now every queued item is persisted the instant it
  // enters the queue and stays persisted until a SERVER row carrying its clientMsgId is observed:
  //
  //     enqueue → persist { clientMsgId, text, sessionId, ts } (sessionStorage, per-tab)
  //     dispatch → item moves to _outboxAwaitingConfirm (STILL persisted — a reload mid-flight restores it)
  //     server row with the clientMsgId observed (adopt pass / pre-send dedupe) → confirmed, released
  //
  // STORAGE CHOICE — sessionStorage, deliberately (vs IndexedDB/localStorage): the payload contract is
  // tiny (a handful of {id, text} strings — no blobs, no attachments), so IndexedDB's async machinery
  // buys nothing; and the outbox is PER-TAB by design (ADR 0008/0012 — a drained send flows through
  // THIS tab's normal canonical-session send path; localStorage is shared across tabs, so two tabs
  // restoring one queue would double-send the same message). sessionStorage is the tab-scoped store
  // that survives a reload — the exact durability owed — and follows the composer-draft precedent
  // (orwellComposerDraft.js, G17). Known boundary: closing the TAB discards its queue (a per-tab queue
  // has no other tab allowed to drain it); that residual is #891's cross-tab/service-worker tier.
  //
  // AT-MOST-ONCE across a reload: restored (and network-requeued) items carry `needsDedupe` — before
  // re-dispatch, ONE /api/history fetch drops any item whose client_msg_id the server already has
  // (the server stamps it on the persisted user row, chat_helpers.add_user_message). Fail-closed: if
  // the check cannot run, the item stays queued and the backoff retries — never an unverified re-send.
  //
  // HONEST STATUS (#891 P0-2): a queued bubble carries a real-text-node `.queued-tag` ('queued' /
  // 'queued — offline' — same a11y reasoning as `.unsent-tag`), the drain gates on navigator.onLine,
  // and the 'online' event + a capped exponential backoff auto-drain the queue. A send attempted
  // while OFFLINE goes straight to the outbox (no doomed POST), and a send that dies at the network
  // layer before any byte arrived is classified (`_isNetworkSendFailure`) and re-queued instead of
  // surfacing as a raw error.
  // chatState._outboxAwaitingConfirm: dispatched, not yet server-confirmed (persisted alongside the queue). #1414 R3 PR0.
  //
  // ── #891 F-A7 (per-bubble delivery state): the DURABLE-FAILED bucket ──
  // A message's lifecycle is queued → sending → delivered | failed, projected onto its user bubble
  // (`dataset.deliveryState`, a REAL text/aria surface — never CSS-only) and — the load-bearing half
  // — persisted so a RELOAD shows the TRUE state, not a stranded pending bubble. queued/sending are
  // already reload-durable (the queue + awaiting-confirm records above); `delivered` releases the
  // durable copy. The missing terminal state is `failed`: a send that exhausted its network-requeue
  // cap (`_OUTBOX_MAX_RETRIES`) used to be DROPPED to the generic error surface, so a reload lost the
  // "not delivered" signal entirely. Such items now live here — persisted (`state:'failed'`),
  // repainted on reload, HELD OUT of the auto-drain, and cleared only by an explicit per-bubble Retry
  // (which re-enters the ONE normal flush, `needsDedupe`-armed) or by a server row proving the POST
  // did land after all (`_outboxConfirmDelivery`). Kept separate from `_sendOutbox` so the drain,
  // backoff, and aggregation never touch a terminally-failed turn.
  // chatState._outboxFailed holds these durable terminally-failed items. Moved to chatState.js, #1414 R3 PR0.
  //
  // ── #830 (optimistic-always + aggregated unsent queue): the AGGREGATION lane ──
  // The owner's ruling: "aggregate what you send quickly … when it's time to send the payload it
  // sends all messages in one turn." Items queued WHILE A TURN WAS STREAMING (the rapid-succession
  // case — the player keeps talking while the model replies) carry `coalesce: true`; at drain time
  // a same-lane run of such items FOLDS into ONE combined turn (`_foldOutboxBatch`): one payload
  // (texts joined by a blank line), ONE clientMsgId (the head's), ONE bubble (the batch's separate
  // pending bubbles collapse into a single combined bubble via the same render path), ONE server
  // row. A single queued item dispatches byte-identical to the pre-#830 path (no fold, no marker).
  // DELIBERATELY NOT aggregated: OFFLINE-queued, network-requeued and reload-RESTORED items — each
  // is its own at-most-once idempotency unit (its POST may already have reached the server, so the
  // per-item `needsDedupe` verification and per-item drain of #891/#1379 must stand; folding items
  // with divergent delivery states could double- or half-send a batch). Aggregation therefore
  // requires `coalesce && !needsDedupe`, and never crosses a same-lane item that can't join (order
  // within a conversation is preserved). When ≥2 items sit queued, an aggregated status strip
  // (`#send-queue-strip`, role="status" — real text, WCAG 4.1.3) shows the count + a manual
  // "Send now" retry that resets the backoff and drains through the ONE normal flush.
