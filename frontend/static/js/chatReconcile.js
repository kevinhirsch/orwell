/**
 * #1414 (R3 PR7): the cross-device RECONCILE / seq-order / peer-resume cluster (ADR 0008/0012).
 *
 * The next extraction from the chat.js god-object (docs/REFACTOR-ROADMAP.md, R3), building on PR0
 * (chatState.js) + PR1 (chatScrollEdges) + PR2 (chatSubmitButton) + PR3 (chatAttachments) + PR4
 * (chatWsSplice) + PR5 (chatMessageActions) + PR6 (chatOutbox). Moved VERBATIM from chat.js —
 * behavior-preserving, no logic change (the 2-space indentation is kept exactly so the source-pin
 * gates slice unchanged):
 *   - `_historyMsgText` / `_serverMsgId` / `_isSkippableUserPrompt` — the history-row text/id/skip
 *       helpers (isSkippableUserPrompt is the ONE source of truth both this reconcile and sessions.js
 *       filter through; re-exported on chatModule).
 *   - `_msgSeq` / `_insertBySeq` / `_reorderBySeq` — BUG 1 (ADR 0008): render BY the authoritative
 *       `data-seq` (a pure read + the insert choke point + the non-destructive in-place reorder).
 *   - `_isEmptyTurnNoSave` — BUG 2 (#985 P2-B): the pure clean-empty-turn predicate.
 *   - `_visibleMsgCount` / `_isPendingOptimisticBubble` / `_expectedVisibleBubbleCount` — F5 / #873
 *       (dedup hardening): the orphan-aware bubble count + its multi-round oracle.
 *   - `softReloadHistory` — the ADR-0008 render-and-reconcile total-order rebuild (adopt pass →
 *       non-destructive reorder → divergence check → seq-ordered rebuild only when DIVERGED/forced),
 *       the #836 pending-bubble rescue, and the ADR-0012 GAP-2 one-shot forced-rebuild self-guard.
 *   - `flushPendingReconcile` / `deferPeerResume` / `flushPendingPeerResume` — the stream-settle
 *       reconcile flush + the ADR-0012 GAP-1 deferred peer-resume seam.
 *
 * The reconcile Sets (`_pendingReconcile` / `_pendingPeerResume` / `_forceRebuild`) and the outbox
 * queues live on the shared `chatState` singleton (PR0) — read/written as `chatState.X` here exactly
 * as in chat.js, so the submit path (chat.js), the outbox (chatOutbox.js), and this reconcile all
 * serialize on ONE instance. `#1085`/`#1086`/`#873` minefield preserved unchanged: this stays
 * pure-DOM/reconcile with NO session-binding side-effects (binding stays validated-before-subscribe +
 * unbind-on-delete in sessions.js/sessionSync.js, which CALL this cluster via `window.chatModule`).
 *
 * Coupling: three chat.js-internal deps injected at module-eval via `_setReconcileDeps`.
 *   - `hasActiveStream` — the SSE-reader liveness helper. It STAYS in chat.js (it reads the shared
 *     chatState stream maps directly); softReloadHistory + flushPendingPeerResume gate on it.
 *   - `resumeStream` — the live-resume attach. It STAYS in chat.js (the R2 live-render/resume cluster);
 *     flushPendingPeerResume calls it once our own stream settles.
 *   - API_BASE — a chat.js `let` set once in init(). Injected as a `() => API_BASE` resolver, read live
 *     inside `softReloadHistory` (the PR3/PR5/PR6 apiBase pattern) — no stale snapshot.
 * Everything else is importable: chatRenderer / ui / sessions / markdown / chatState, plus
 * `_outboxConfirmDelivery` from chatOutbox.js (the adopt pass releases a delivered outbox copy).
 *
 * Public API preserved: chat.js imports the moved functions and re-exports the browser-gate ones on
 * the `chatModule` object byte-identically (`softReloadHistory`, `flushPendingReconcile`,
 * `deferPeerResume`, `flushPendingPeerResume`, `isSkippableUserPrompt`, `_msgSeq`, `_insertBySeq`,
 * `_reorderBySeq`, `_isEmptyTurnNoSave`, `_visibleMsgCount`, `_expectedVisibleBubbleCount`).
 * sessions.js (`isSkippableUserPrompt`) and sessionSync.js (`softReloadHistory` / `deferPeerResume`)
 * reach this cluster through those `window.chatModule` re-exports, unchanged.
 *
 * Dual-load idempotent (#1399 generalized): the state is chatState-backed (one shared instance); this
 * module holds no module-level timers/listeners. Imported BY chat.js only (never app.js / an html
 * shell), so #1399 single-eval holds.

   *
   * The server assigns a monotonic `seq` per session (UNIQUE(session_id, seq)); the FE log is a
   * replica of that total order. Every live insert (optimistic user send, stream holder, peer
   * resume holder) is necessarily append-to-bottom because seq isn't known until the row persists —

   * but only when DIVERGED and only when idle, leaving a visible out-of-seq window mid-stream.
   *
   * The structural fix: a single seq read (`_msgSeq`) + a single non-destructive reorder
   * (`_reorderBySeq`) that the reconcile's ADOPT PASS runs on every reconcile attempt (it runs even
   * while a stream is in flight — the `hasActiveStream` early-return is AFTER the adopt pass). A
   * bubble that has been stamped with `data-seq` is moved into ascending-seq position WITHOUT a DOM
   * wipe, reordering ONLY among the seq'd bubbles' own slots; bubbles with NO seq yet (a still-pending
   * optimistic send, the LIVE streaming holder, an un-adopted orphan) and non-`.msg` nodes (tool
   * threads) never move — so the live holder is never torn from its threads. Idempotent: a no-op when
