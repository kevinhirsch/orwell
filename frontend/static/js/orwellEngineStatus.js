// Orwell engine-status banner — VISIBLE error reporting when the game engine has a problem.
// The in-character "live feeds are down" chat line keeps players in the show, but the operator (and
// a confused player) needs an honest, out-of-character signal that something is actually broken. This
// is that signal: a top-of-viewport banner driven by /api/orwell/health with two severities:
//   • RED   — the engine is unreachable (connection refused / timeout / wrong URL);
//   • AMBER — the engine is up but a recent tool call FAILED (`lastError`: a technical problem like a
//     corrupt-save 500 or a failing action). The player sees ONE production-voiced line either way;
//     the raw tool name + backend error (the actionable operator detail) goes to console + OrwellReport
//     (the /admin/status failure ring), never into the player-visible banner body (MICRO-14/15).
// Fail-open (if its own fetch fails, it shows the warning), no deps beyond the notice kit.
//
// #642 (owner add-on): the banner is a first-class OrwellNotice kit consumer — a "system-notice"
// kind at the "top-banner" placement, so it shares the kit's chrome, ONE dismiss affordance (the
// 44px .on-dismiss), role/aria-live=alert semantics, reduced-motion-safe slide-in, and the
// body-inset compensation (now kit-owned: --on-banner-inset). It KEEPS its top-anchored,
// full-width placement (a global outage signal, not an above-composer affordance) and the
// dismissed-key behaviour (re-show only when the message changes; reset on healthy). The G8
// busy/creating hold + the reconnecting/holding variants are unchanged.
