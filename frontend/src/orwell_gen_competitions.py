"""Feature #1400 (FE lane) — GENERATIVE COMPETITION DESIGN: the model DRESSES the engine's fixed roll.

The engine resolves each staged competition as ONE calibrated roll UP FRONT — the crown and the full
drop order are fixed before any staging renders. This module is the FE-owned author that, AFTER the roll
commits, invents the week's competition (theme + staging premise + per-round elimination fiction) MATCHED
to that already-decided outcome, and writes it BACK so the engine stays the source of truth
(``recordCompetitionFiction``). The FE owns the concrete utility LLM exactly as it owns the 0062 zeitgeist
/ 0058 cast-authoring write-backs; the engine treats the write-back as presentation-only season flavor.

THE SAFETY PROPERTY (why this is approvable): the model can never touch the result. It is handed the
FIXED drop order and authors prose for each drop IN THAT ORDER; the engine then RE-VALIDATES that every
elimination maps to its fixed drop order EXACTLY and REJECTS any mismatch — on a reject the deterministic
0042 competition-library floor simply stands. Best-effort + background + fail-soft: no model, no usable
output, or a rejected write-back ⇒ the 0042 floor stands (byte-identical to the pre-feature model).

COST CAP (#1400): exactly ONE utility completion per competition (~2/week — one HOH + one veto), fired
fire-and-forget with a per-(user, comp) in-flight guard. Tests inject deps; nothing depends on a live model.
