"""Feature 0065 (Part D) — the per-turn LLM↔engine sync/divergence ledger.

The 0065 spine makes the *closed set* (facts, outcomes, bookkeeping) rigorously synced
between the narration LLM and the deterministic engine. Part D is its **observability**
slice: a single, structured, per-turn record of *what the harness did to keep things
synced* — so "I have to debug the harness a lot" stops meaning grepping scattered ad-hoc
``logger.info`` lines.

Each turn produces one entry::

    { turnId, session, beatSeqBefore, beatSeqAfter, toolsCalled, nudgesFired,
      autoBackfills, desyncDetected, staleRejections, idempotencyHits }

Dedup decision vs. PR #406 (REQUIRED by the spec) — SIBLING, not an extension
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PR #406 shipped ``src/llm_trace.py`` + the ``log_rings.LLMIO`` ring: a **full LLM I/O
trace** — every model call recorded with the *full request* (system prompt + every
message + tool schemas + sampling params) and the *full response* (assistant text +
reasoning + tool calls + usage). It is:

  * **payload-bearing** (it exists precisely to capture prompt/response *bodies*),
  * **global / not user-scoped** (one ``data/llm-io.jsonl`` archive + one in-memory ring,
    keyed by call, with horizon-days retention + a "Trim now" button), and
  * **per model-call**, not per game turn.

This ledger is deliberately the **inverse**: it is **Vault-free and body-free by
construction** (ids / counts / event NAMES / small booleans only — *never* a message
body, narration, casting answer, or any engine secret), it is **per-``_current_user``
scoped and isolated** (one user can never read another's entries), and it aggregates at
the **turn** grain (counts of nudges / back-fills / stale rejections, the beatSeq
before→after). Folding turn-grain closed-set counters into #406's full-payload,
global, retention-governed archive would either (a) dilute that archive's "everything
in/out of the LLM" purpose, or (b) require re-introducing user scoping and a body-free
discipline that #406 explicitly does not have. So the non-duplicative path is a
**small sibling store** that mirrors the existing per-user FE stores
(``orwell_seasons.py`` / ``orwell_layout.py`` — a bounded JSON map in ``DATA_DIR``,
atomically written, ``_current_user``-keyed) and emits **one structured ``[orwell]``
log line per turn** through the project logger (which the #406 ``log_rings.LIVE`` root
handler already taps for the admin viewer — so the turn line is visible there *without*
this module ever touching #406's payload archive).

Boundaries
----------
  * **Vault-free by construction (hard invariant).** ``record_turn`` coerces every input
    to a small scalar / id / name and drops anything else; no free-form text field is
    ever stored. The closed-set counters carry no game secret.
  * **Bounded.** Per-user retention is a ring (drop oldest beyond the cap).
  * **Per-user isolated.** Entries live under the user's key; ``get_recent`` answers only
    that user's slice.
  * **Logging must never hurt the app.** The recorder swallows its own errors.
