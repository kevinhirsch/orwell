"""Feature 0062 (FE lane) — capture the real-world MOVE-IN ZEITGEIST via web search.

The engine seeds a deterministic ``model-framed`` ``WorldSnapshot`` at season creation (the fail-soft
floor — generic, date-unaware pools). This module is the FE-owned ``web_search`` provider that REPLACES
it ONCE per season with a REAL capture of the move-in-era zeitgeist — the shared movies/music/sports/
news/internet/mood the whole cast walked in with, frozen with a deliberate ~7-day lag (settled, not
bleeding-edge). The FE owns the concrete search provider exactly as it owns the 0051 image provider; the
engine treats the write-back as outward-safe season flavor (``recordWorldSnapshot``).

Hard rules (0062 §6/§8): FLAVOR ONLY — it never informs a game outcome; best-effort + background —
no model OR no usable output ⇒ the deterministic fallback simply stands; captured ONCE then frozen +
recalled all season (the engine persists it). Tests never depend on a live search (the orchestrator
takes injected deps; §9/§10).
