"""Feature 0070 — off-screen society texture enrichment (FE lane).

The engine records off-screen NPC-to-NPC scenes with a deterministic id-slug template (e.g.
``npc:3 gossiped about the house with npc:7``). This module is the FE-owned model-voiced
prose layer: it fans out in parallel (the hermes subagent pattern), voices each scene's
SKELETON (Vault-free — public participant ids + nature only) as a short, vivid in-character
prose beat, and writes each voiced beat back to the engine (``recordOffscreenSceneTexture``).

Hard rules (0070 §§3-6):
- CONTENT ONLY — the write-back cannot alter the witness set, flip the hidden flag, or carry
  any relationship number. The engine enforces this at the MCP boundary.
- FAIL-SOFT — no model OR no usable output ⇒ the deterministic template content simply stands;
  the game advance is never blocked.
- NOT a model lever — the GM-facing manifest does not list these tools; they are FE/infra only.
- Never surfaces enriched prose directly to the player — the existing overhear/gossip pathways
  remain the only route from a hidden scene to the player's knowledge.
- Budget-capped — at most ``MAX_SCENES_PER_TICK`` scenes voiced per tick; skeletons beyond
  that budget retain their deterministic template.
- Idempotent — writing the same texture twice is harmless; the last write wins.
