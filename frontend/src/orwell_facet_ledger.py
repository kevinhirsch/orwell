"""T0-6 — the ONE Casting Bible: the cast-wide seeded FacetLedger.

Minted BEFORE any LLM call, the ledger deals every houseguest slot a HAND of closed casting
facets from STRATIFIED per-cast budgets (with seeded jitter + rare-outlier slots):

  * vocation family      — which corner of the working world this person comes from
  * region / hometown    — a US region bucket + a town-size directive
  * height / build       — the physical silhouette
  * complexion depth     — a steering cue only (the 0063 heritage grounding stays the authority
                           at the engine's recordCastProfile write-back — the ledger spreads the
                           steering, the committed heritage wins)
  * hair                 — texture/length spread, with a seeded 0-2 bold-styled outlier slots
  * voice tic            — one habitual verbal quirk, unique per slot
  * name phonology       — a per-slot name-shape directive (syllables/initials), killing the
                           model's default-name clustering at the source

Marks/ink are deliberately NOT re-dealt here: the #1768 ink slot semantics (a seeded 2-4 inked
slots per cast on the ``:genesis:looks`` side-stream) stay exactly where they live —
``orwell_cast_genesis.assign_genesis_slots`` — and the ledger hand rides BESIDE that deal.

Every authoring lane receives its NPC's dealt hand + the cast-wide taken-list in its prompt
(genesis: ``build_genesis_messages`` renders the hand into the casting card and aggregates the
sibling hands as the taken-list; deep authoring: ``build_authoring_messages`` threads the hand +
the siblings' COMMITTED facets). Because the hands are disjoint by construction, 15 concurrent
per-NPC calls can no longer collide on the model's default picks (the "San Diego x2" /
"smokejumper cluster" class) — which is what makes the 15-wide single-wave genesis safe.

DETERMINISM: every deal runs on its OWN dedicated side-stream (``{seed}:ledger:<facet>``) of the
same mulberry32/FNV-1a pair the engine and the genesis port use — same seed ⇒ same ledger, and
adding/removing one facet never perturbs another. Pure functions, no wall clock, no global RNG.

STEERING, NEVER A VALIDATOR: like the season brief, the ledger steers the model's open-ended
generation; the engine's envelope (clamps / dedupe backstop / the T0-6 closed-facet-diff
validator at recordCastProfile) is what binds.
