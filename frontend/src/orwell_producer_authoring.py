"""Issue #1626 (increment 3, FE lane) — DEEPEN the off-camera casting PRODUCER persona.

The engine seeds a deterministic producer at season creation — a stable NAME (the byline) plus a thin
``archetype`` / ``demeanor`` / ``disposition`` / ``wit`` / ``quirk`` / ``backstory`` floor. This module
is the FE-owned utility-LLM driver that DEEPENS that persona ONCE with a richer authored overlay written
BACK via ``recordProducerProfile`` — the mirror of the 0058 cast-authoring handshake
(``orwell_cast_authoring``), scaled to the single producer:

    engine seeds the deterministic producer floor
      → the FE utility-LLM authors a richer backstory / temperament / demeanor / disposition / wit / quirk
      → the FE writes it back via recordProducerProfile (the engine validates OPEN-SET voice PROSE only,
        strips any Vault/stat vocabulary, ACCUMULATES onto the seeded floor, and NEVER changes the
        seeded NAME)
      → the engine is now the source of truth.

Hard rules (mirror ``orwell_cast_authoring`` / #1626):
  * the seeded NAME is NEVER changed — the byline stays byte-stable (we never even send one; the engine
    ignores a ``name`` field anyway);
  * Vault-free BY CONSTRUCTION — no stat / number / hidden field is authored (the engine strips any that
    slips through regardless);
  * best-effort + background — no model/provider ⇒ the engine's seeded floor simply STANDS (an
    expected-empty, not a failure); a REAL error is logged, never swallowed silently (#1599), but never
    raised into the caller (game start must never block on it).

The orchestrator (``author_producer``) takes INJECTED deps (``llm_fn`` / ``write_fn``) so the whole lane
is unit-testable without a live model or engine, exactly like ``orwell_zeitgeist.capture_zeitgeist``.
