"""Feature 0065 — cast pre-warm orchestration (FE side).

The owner ruling: the player must start the actual game with a FULLY WARMED AUTHORSHIP before any
portrait is ever generated.

* **Author warm** fires at the earliest opportunity (a model is selectable, before the season begins):
  the engine pre-seeds the player-INDEPENDENT cast and the FE deeply authors it in the background,
  writing each profile back to the engine (``recordCastProfile``).
* **Portrait warm** is HELD until the first interview turn and, when it runs, WAITS for author warm to
  fully finish before generating any face — so portraits always read a finished, deeply authored store.

Both are idempotent per user and best-effort: with no model configured, author warm no-ops and portrait
warm declines (``createCharacter``'s own fallback then owns portraits). The author-done gate is released
on authoring completion *whether it succeeded or failed*, so portrait warm can never hang.

# touching the active season. The FE then deeply authors the held cast in the background (write-back onto
# the holding store), releasing the author-done gate Phase-2 portraits gate off. The confirmed cutover
# ADOPTS the held cast. No FE poll-until-the-one-game-sandbox-frees-up is needed any longer; this is a
# single real warm fired as a fire-and-forget background task. Best-effort, idempotent, fail-soft: no
