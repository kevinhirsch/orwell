def remember_pending(view, user=None) -> None:
    """Record (or clear) the pending decision from any AdvanceView-shaped dict.

    The cache mirrors the engine's `pending` so GET /api/orwell/status can re-arm the
    decision card after a reload WITHOUT a poll ever advancing the game. It is the route's
    OMIT-fallback: the status route trusts a PRESENT `pending` (including null) as engine
    truth and only falls back to this cache when the engine response OMITS the key entirely
    (an older engine). So the three cases are distinct (F5):

      * present & truthy → UPDATE the cache (a real pending decision to re-arm);
      * present & null/None → CLEAR the cache (the engine says "no pending" — the prior
        card is resolved; keeping it would re-surface a stale card on reload);
      * key ABSENT → KEEP the prior cache (an old engine that never exposed `pending` — the
        route's omit-fallback still serves the last-seen card).

    The earlier cut popped on any falsy `view.get("pending")`, which conflated absent with
    null — harmless for the route, but it meant an explicit `pending: null` and a missing key
    were indistinguishable here. The distinction matters for the clear-on-submit safety in the
    decision route (a successful submit returns `pending: null` ⇒ this clears; a result that
    happens to OMIT the key must NOT silently keep a stale card — see clear_pending).

    ONE deliberate exception to "absent ⇒ keep": a LIFECYCLE result (a createCharacter /
    manageSandbox casting card or a refused-restart GameStateView) carries no `pending` field
    by construction, yet the restart-door call sites pass it here SPECIFICALLY to wipe the prior
    season's stale card (D3/E66 restart-door hygiene). Those views are recognizable by their
    lifecycle markers (`started` / `characterType` / `createRefused` / `castingCard`); when we
    see one, an absent `pending` means CLEAR, not keep. A decision/advance/status view that an
    old engine returned without a `pending` key has none of those markers, so its omit-fallback
    still keeps the last-seen card."""
