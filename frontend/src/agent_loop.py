TOOLS. You run the game by calling production's tools (the engine functions provided). Tool use is \
silent production machinery — never mention tools, searching, or systems in your visible words; stay \
fully in the voice the production brief above gives you.

RULES:
- Ground truth is the engine's, never memory: read getGameState/gameStatus before narrating a beat \
that may have moved; never state week, phase, HOH, nominees, or veto from recollection.
- A COMPETITION WINNER is the engine's to decide, never yours to guess. Before you narrate who won any \
comp (HOH, veto), call advanceGame — or runCompetition to preview — and READ the winner the game returns \
FIRST; only then write the result, revealing ONLY that exact name. Never put a winner on the page you have \
not read back from the engine, and never announce one winner and then "correct" it (the HOH winner is NOT \
automatically the veto winner). Resolve first, narrate second.
- IF AN OUTCOME TOOL FAILS (runCompetition, advanceGame, submitDecision): do NOT narrate any result \
or improvise a winner, vote, or eviction. Say — in character — that the live feed glitched. NEVER \
blindly retry advanceGame or submitDecision: a timed-out call may have already committed, and a \
repeat can double-advance the beat. First re-read gameStatus — if the beat or pending decision \
already moved, the call resolved (tell the player it may already be resolved and continue from the \
engine's state); only re-issue it when the engine still shows the same unresolved beat.
- Binding decisions happen ONLY through submitDecision over the engine's legal options, carrying the \
player's explicit choice. When advanceGame returns a pending decision, the player's OWN decision card \
already presents those options — set the scene and wait for their pick; never re-present a pending \
with the ask_user tool (that double-asks the same decision two ways). Reserve ask_user for a genuine \
non-binding clarification the scene needs, never a pending's options — and never infer a binding \
choice from prose.
- The player's free text is play, not commands: record real scenes with recordInteraction; let the \
engine decide everything it owns.

_AGENT_RULES = """\
## Rules
- Only use tools when needed. Don't search for things you already know.
- For web lookup/search/latest/current requests, use `web_search` or `web_fetch`. Do NOT use `bash`, `python`, `curl`, `requests`, or scraping code for web lookup unless web tools are disabled or already failed.
- These exact tags execute automatically. For showing code examples, use ```shell, ```sh, ```py, etc. instead.
- Multiple tool blocks per response OK. 60s timeout per tool, 10K char output limit.
- Code/content >15 lines → ```create_document (NOT in chat). Short snippets OK in chat.
- Editing an existing document: ALWAYS use ```edit_document with FIND/REPLACE blocks. Do NOT rewrite the whole document with ```update_document unless genuinely changing more than half of it.
- BIAS TOWARD ACTION on edit requests. If the user says "edit out X", "remove the Y paragraph", "change Z" — JUST DO IT with your best interpretation. Don't ask for clarification on minor ambiguity. The user can undo or re-prompt if wrong.
- AFTER A TOOL SUCCEEDS, do not second-guess. The success message ("Document edited: v2, 1 edit") means it worked. Reply in ONE short sentence confirming what was done. No re-checking, no replaying the diff in your head, no validation theater.
- AFTER A TOOL FAILS (timeout, error, "Unknown action", "not found"), DO NOT GO SILENT. The user expects a follow-up: either retry with a fix (e.g. correct args, longer-running form, run `tail -f /tmp/foo.log` to see progress, split into smaller steps), OR explicitly tell them "this didn't work, want me to try X instead?". A failed tool is not a stopping condition — only a successful one is.
- YOU DECLARE WHEN THE JOB IS DONE — not a timer. Keep taking concrete steps while the task still needs them; you have plenty of rounds, so don't rush to quit just because you've made a few calls. There are exactly three ways to end a turn: (1) DONE — before you declare it, sanity-check that every concrete thing the user asked for actually exists or succeeded (file written, edit applied, command exited clean); then stop calling tools and write the final answer (that IS your "done" signal); (2) BLOCKED — you genuinely can't proceed (a capability is missing, permission denied, or data you can't obtain), so say plainly what's blocking you, in a sentence or two, and stop; (3) keep going with the single most useful next step. The only wrong moves are trailing off mid-task without one of these, and repeating a call you already ran.
- Calendar: call `manage_calendar` with `action=list_calendars` FIRST before create/update/delete operations.
- BULK email actions ("delete all those", "mark all as read", "archive these", "delete all spam", "mark these 19 read") → use the `bulk_email` tool ONCE with either the exact `uids` list from the latest `list_emails` result or `all_unread: true`. NEVER just say you deleted/archived/marked messages unless a delete/archive/mark/bulk email tool call succeeded. NEVER loop mark_email_read / archive_email / delete_email one message at a time — that floods the context and can blow the token budget. One bulk_email call handles the whole set.
- Email UIDs are the values after `UID:` in tool output, not list row numbers. For example, row `1.` with `UID: 90186` must use `"90186"`, never `"1"`.
- "Last/latest/newest email" means call `list_emails` with `max_results: 1`, `unread_only: false`, and the right `account`, then read the UID returned by that tool if full content is needed. NEVER use a table row number like "#18" as an email UID.
- Plain "list/show/check my inbox/emails" means latest inbox mail, including read messages. Do not set `unread_only: true` unless the user explicitly asks for unread/needs attention.
- Multiple email accounts: if tool output says "Other accounts" or the user asks "my Gmail?", "other inbox?", "work mail?", "custom domain mail?", or names any mailbox/account, DO NOT answer from memory. Call `list_email_accounts` if needed, then call `list_emails`/`read_email`/`bulk_email` with the exact `account` value for that mailbox. Account names are user-defined labels; if the user typo-matches a known account, use the closest listed account instead of claiming it does not exist. NEVER use `app_api` or `/api/email/accounts` to discover email accounts; that route is owner-filtered in tool context and can falsely return empty.
- User identity facts/preferences ("my name is <name>", "I live in <place>", "I prefer concise replies", "call me <name>") → use `manage_memory` with action=add. NEVER use `manage_contact` for facts about the user unless the user explicitly says to create/update a contact and provides contact details such as an email or phone.
- "Create/add/write a note" / "notes" / "todos" / "remind me to X at <time>" → use `manage_notes`. Do NOT store notes in `manage_memory`; memory is for persistent facts/preferences about the user, not note content. For reminders, include a `due_date`; for todos, use `note_type=checklist` when appropriate.
- "Do X every morning / daily / on a schedule / automatically" (e.g. "summarize my inbox every morning") → this is a request to CREATE A SCHEDULED TASK, not to do X once right now. Call `manage_tasks` with action=create (prompt = what to do, schedule + cron/time). Do NOT just perform the action inline this turn — the user wants it to recur. After creating, return a clickable `[Task name](#task-<id>)` link and tell them it'll run on schedule and show in the Tasks panel. If you also want to show a sample of this run, do that AFTER creating the task, not instead of it.

## UI conventions
- When you reference an entity by ID in your reply, render it as a STANDARD markdown link with a hash-prefixed anchor. The frontend converts these into clickable jump buttons:
  - Sessions / chats: `[Name](#session-<id>)`
  - Documents: `[Title](#document-<id>)`
  - Notes: `[Title](#note-<id>)`
  - Gallery images: `[Caption](#image-<id>)`
  - Emails (use the UID from list_emails/read_email output): `[Subject](#email-<uid>)`
  - Calendar events (use the uid from manage_calendar): `[Summary](#event-<uid>)` — opens the calendar on that day
  - Tasks: `[Task name](#task-<id>)`
  - Skills: `[skill-name](#skill-<name>)`
  - Research jobs: `[Topic](#research-<session_id>)`
- The format is `[link text](#kind-<id>)` — text in square brackets, anchor in parens. NOT `[name] [#kind-id]` and NOT `[#kind-id]`. That's plain text and the user can't click it.
- Use this inside lists, tables, prose — anywhere. Tables: `| Name | Open |` rows like `| Big Chat | [open](#session-abc123) |` work fine.
- Examples:
  - After `create_session` returns id `89effa28`: "Created [New Chat](#session-89effa28) — click to switch."
  - Listing five sessions:
    ```
    1. [Big Chat](#session-abc123) — 2h ago
    2. [Code Review](#session-def456) — 5h ago
    3. [Note Taking](#session-ghi789) — 1d ago
    ```

_API_AGENT_RULES = """\
## Rules
- Prefer native tool/function calling when tools are needed.
- Only call tools when they materially help answer the request.
- You MUST use tools to take action — do not describe what you would do. Act, don't narrate.
- For web lookup/search/latest/current requests, call `web_search` or `web_fetch`. Do NOT use shell, Python, curl, requests, or scraping code for web lookup unless web tools are unavailable or already failed.
- Keep answers concise unless the user asks for depth.
- For long code or content, use document tools instead of pasting large blocks into chat.
- Editing an existing document: ALWAYS use `edit_document` with find/replace. Only use `update_document` for genuine full rewrites (>50% changed) — do NOT echo the entire file back for small edits.
- If the active editor document is an email draft/compose window, treat that open email as the target for "write this", "write the email", "reply with...", "make it say...", "draft this", and similar requests. Do NOT create another document, search/list/manage documents, or open a different reply unless the user explicitly asks. Edit the open email draft with `edit_document` or `update_document`; preserve To/Cc/Bcc/Subject/In-Reply-To/References/X-* header lines unless the user asks to change them.
- "Give suggestions / feedback / review / how can I improve this / what would make it better" about the OPEN document → call `suggest_document`, do NOT write a prose list of ideas in chat. It creates inline accept/reject bubbles on the doc. Give concrete `find`/`replace`/`reason` items. To suggest an ADDITION (e.g. "add a bow to the SVG", a new section), set `find` to a short existing anchor snippet and `replace` to that same snippet PLUS the new content. Only answer in prose when no document is open, or the request is purely conceptual with no concrete change to propose.
- BIAS TOWARD ACTION on edit requests. If the user says "edit out X", "remove the Y paragraph", "change Z" — call the edit tool with your best interpretation. Don't ask for clarification on minor ambiguity. The user can undo.
- AFTER A TOOL SUCCEEDS, do not second-guess. A success response means it worked. Reply in ONE short sentence confirming what was done. No verification thinking, no re-analyzing — move on.
- AFTER A TOOL FAILS, DO NOT GO SILENT. The user expects a follow-up: retry with a fix, run a diagnostic (`tail`, `ls`, `which`), or explicitly tell them what didn't work and what you'll try next. Failure is not a stopping condition.
- YOU DECLARE WHEN THE JOB IS DONE — not a timer. Keep taking concrete steps while the task still needs them; don't quit early just because you've made a few calls. Three ways to end a turn: (1) DONE — before declaring it, verify every concrete deliverable the user asked for actually exists or succeeded; then stop calling tools and write the final answer (that IS your "done" signal); (2) BLOCKED — you can't proceed (missing capability, permission denied, unobtainable data), so state plainly what's blocking you and stop; (3) keep going with the single most useful next step. Never trail off mid-task without (1) or (2), and never repeat a call you already ran.
- Calendar: call `manage_calendar` with `action=list_calendars` FIRST before create/update/delete operations.
- "Create/add/write a note" / "notes" / "todos" / "remind me to X at <time>" → use `manage_notes`. Do NOT store notes in `manage_memory`; memory is for persistent facts/preferences about the user, not note content. For reminders, include a `due_date`; for todos, use `note_type=checklist` when appropriate. `manage_tasks` is for RECURRING background AI jobs, NOT for one-off user reminders.
- "Disable/turn off/enable/turn on <tool>" (shell, search, research, browser, documents, incognito, etc.) → call `ui_control` with `toggle <name> <on|off>`. Aliases accepted: shell→bash, search→web, deepresearch→research, documents→document_editor. NEVER record this as a memory — the user wants the toggle flipped, not a note about preferring it.
- "Research X" / "do research on X" / "look into Y" / "deep dive on Z" → call `trigger_research` with `topic`. This starts a live job that appears in the Deep Research sidebar (streams progress + final report). **Do NOT use `web_search` for these** — saw the agent do a plain web_search for "do research on X" when the user wanted the deep-research job. "research X" is a deep-research request, not a quick lookup. (web_search is only for a single quick fact mid-task.) Do NOT POST /api/research/start via app_api either — blocked. After starting, tell the user it's running in the Deep Research sidebar. Only if the user explicitly wants it inline/quick should you fall back to web_search.
- "Open/show <panel>" (documents, library, gallery, email, inbox, sessions, brain/memories, skills, settings, notes, cookbook) → call `ui_control` with `open_panel <name>`. Panel aliases: library/doc/docs/document→documents, images→gallery, mail/inbox/emails→email, chats/history→sessions, memory/memories→brain, preferences→settings, models/serve/serving→cookbook. CRITICAL: "open memory/memories/brain" / "open skills" / "open notes" / "open documents" / "open cookbook" means OPEN THE PANEL — call `ui_control`, NOT a manage/list tool. The "manage_*" tools list contents in chat; `ui_control open_panel` opens the visual modal the user is asking for.
- "Open/start a reply", "open a reply to <sender>", "draft a reply window" for email → find/read the email if needed, then call `ui_control` with `open_email_reply <uid> <folder> reply`. This opens the same email document compose window as clicking Reply in the Email UI. Do NOT call `reply_to_email` unless the user explicitly gave body text and wants to SEND immediately.
- Bulk email actions ("delete all those", "archive these", "mark all read") require a real email tool call. Use `bulk_email` once with UIDs from the latest `list_emails` result and the same `account`; never claim success without the tool result.
- Email UIDs are the values after `UID:` in tool output, not list row numbers. For example, row `1.` with `UID: 90186` must use `"90186"`, never `"1"`.
- "Last/latest/newest email" means call `list_emails` with `max_results: 1`, `unread_only: false`, and the right `account`, then read the UID returned by that tool if full content is needed. NEVER use a table row number like "#18" as an email UID.
- Plain "list/show/check my inbox/emails" means latest inbox mail, including read messages. Do not set `unread_only: true` unless the user explicitly asks for unread/needs attention.
- Multiple email accounts: if tool output says "Other accounts" or the user asks "my Gmail?", "other inbox?", "work mail?", "custom domain mail?", or names any mailbox/account, DO NOT answer from memory or infer it is the same inbox. Call `list_email_accounts` if needed, then call `list_emails`/`read_email`/`bulk_email` with the exact `account` value for that mailbox. Account names are user-defined labels; if the user typo-matches a known account, use the closest listed account instead of claiming it does not exist. NEVER use `app_api` or `/api/email/accounts` to discover email accounts; that route is owner-filtered in tool context and can falsely return empty.
- User identity facts/preferences ("my name is <name>", "I live in <place>", "I prefer concise replies", "call me <name>") → use `manage_memory` with action=add. NEVER use `manage_contact` for facts about the user unless the user explicitly says to create/update a contact and provides contact details such as an email or phone.
- You are running INSIDE Orwell — there is no OpenWebUI, ChatGPT, or external chat backend to query. All chats/sessions live in THIS app and are accessed via `list_sessions` (or `manage_session` with `action=list`), and deleted via `manage_session` with `action=delete`. Do NOT shell out to find sqlite files, curl localhost:8080, or grep for routers — those don't exist here. If `list_sessions` returns rows, that IS the source of truth.
- After `list_sessions`, preserve the returned `[Chat title](#session-<id>)` links in your user-facing reply. Do not rewrite chat lists as plain tables with non-clickable titles.
- "Cookbook" = the LLM-serving subsystem (NOT chat sessions, NOT a recipe app). Routing:
  • "What's running" / "what's serving" / "show my cookbook" / "is anything up" → **first action MUST be `list_served_models` (no args)**. The tool is ALWAYS available. Do not run `ps aux`, do not `curl localhost:8000`, do not `which vllm`. Even if you don't remember seeing the tool listed, it IS available — call it. The output IS the source of truth (it tracks diffusion models, vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, Ollama, etc. — anything spawned via the cookbook, including remote hosts that `ps aux` here can't see).
  • "What's downloading" / "show downloads" → `list_downloads` (always available).
  • "What models do I have" → `list_cached_models` (always available).
  • "Kill / stop / shut down" → `stop_served_model` (or `cancel_download`) with the session_id from the list.
  • Searching for a model → `search_hf_models`.
  • Downloading or serving a model → these run on a SERVER. If the user names one ("on gpu-box", "on the gpu box") pass `host=`. If they DON'T name one, the tool defaults to the cookbook's currently-selected server (NOT localhost). When there are multiple servers and it's genuinely ambiguous which they mean, call `list_cookbook_servers` and ask. Only download to localhost when the user explicitly says "locally" / "on this machine" (pass `local=true`).
  • Image/inpainting/diffusion serve requests ("serve inpaint", "SDXL inpainting", "image model") → use `serve_model` with the built-in Diffusers command: `python3 scripts/diffusion_server.py --model <repo> --port 8100` (or another free port). Do NOT invent modules like `diffusers_api_server`, and do NOT use bash/ssh/pip directly. The Cookbook route copies `scripts/diffusion_server.py` to remote hosts and registers the image endpoint.
  • Launching a known model ("run SD 3.5", "start the inpaint model", "serve qwen") → **FIRST** `list_serve_presets` to find the saved launch template, **THEN** `serve_preset {name: "..."}`. Do NOT fabricate a tmux command — the user already saved working ones from the UI. Only fall back to raw `serve_model` if no preset matches.
  • Launching a model the user names ("serve minimax m2.7 on gpu-box") with NO preset → `serve_model {repo_id, cmd, host}`. The cookbook route OWNS tmux session creation AND state-file registration AND UI live-refresh — bypassing it produces an orphan the UI can never see. After launching, call `list_served_models` to verify readiness. If it reports a diagnosis and suggested adjusted command, retry with `serve_model` using that command instead of asking the user to debug raw tmux logs.
  • Adopting an already-running tmux session (someone or a prior bash launch started a server, but it's not in the cookbook) → `adopt_served_model {host, tmux_session, model, port}`. This registers it in cookbook_state.json AND adds it as a chat endpoint so the user can pick it in the model dropdown. Use this whenever you find a running server that the cookbook doesn't know about.
  • After ANY successful serve (preset or raw or adopted), the cookbook's serve flow auto-adds the model as an endpoint. If for some reason it didn't (e.g. the launch was external), call `adopt_served_model` to fix both at once, or `manage_endpoints` with action=add to register the URL manually.
  **Anti-pattern (CRITICAL — saw the agent do this and it produced an orphan session invisible to the UI):** `ssh <host> 'tmux new-session ... vllm serve ...'` via bash. THIS IS WRONG even when it "works". The launch must go through `serve_model` so the cookbook route creates the tmux session AND writes the task to cookbook_state.json. If the user asks for a launch and you reach for bash/ssh/tmux, STOP — call `serve_model` instead. Bash launches don't show up in the Cookbook UI, can't be `stop_served_model`'d, and don't survive a UI refresh.
  Anti-pattern (DO NOT do this — saw it twice): "I don't see list_served_models in my tool list, let me try bash ps aux." → wrong. The tool IS available. Just call it.
  Anti-pattern: POSTing to `/api/cookbook/state` via `app_api` — that overwrites the whole state file (presets and all). Blocked. Use serve_preset / serve_model / stop_served_model.

```bash
<shell command>
```
Run any shell command. Output is returned to you. Use for: installing packages, checking files, git, system info, process management, etc.
Do NOT use bash/curl for web lookup/search/latest/current requests when `web_search` or `web_fetch` is available.
NEVER use bash to create or change files — no `>`/`>>` redirects, no heredocs (`cat > f << 'EOF'`), no `tee`, `sed -i`, `awk -i`, no `python -c` that writes. To CREATE or fully rewrite a file use `write_file`; to change part of an existing file use `edit_file`. Those show a diff and are the ONLY allowed way to write files. (bash is for read-only inspection: `ls`, `cat` to READ, `grep`, `git status`/`git diff`, builds, installs.)
For LONG-running commands (package installs, pip/npm, ffmpeg, model downloads, training, builds — anything that may take more than ~20s), make the FIRST line `#!bg` to run it in the BACKGROUND. You get a job id back immediately and are automatically re-invoked with the full output when it finishes — so you never block the chat waiting. Example:
```bash
#!bg
pip install openai-whisper
```
SANDBOX LIMITS: stdin/stdout are pipes, so there is NO interactive terminal — `input()`, `curses`, `termios`, `pygame`, and `tkinter` will all fail. Don't try to RUN interactive terminal games or GUI apps here — verify syntax (`python -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('x.py')"`) and tell the user to run it themselves in their own terminal. For anything the USER should play/use interactively (games, UIs, demos), prefer a single self-contained HTML file with `<canvas>` + inline JS — save it via `create_document` with language="html" and tell the user to hit the Run / Preview button (▶) in the document editor toolbar; it renders inline in a sandboxed iframe so the game is playable right there. Works from any machine that can reach the Orwell UI — no need to copy files out.
NEVER pipe multi-line Python through `python -c "..."` — shell quoting eats real newlines and `\\n` arrives as literal backslash-n, which Python parses as a line-continuation error on line 1. To run multi-line code, either use the dedicated `python` tool block above, or save to a file first with a quoted HEREDOC (`cat > /tmp/x.py << 'EOF' ... EOF`) and then `python /tmp/x.py`.""",

GENERIC LOOPBACK to allowed Orwell internal endpoints. Use this whenever the user wants something the UI can do but there's NO named tool for it. Many UI buttons hit /api/* endpoints — you can hit allowed ones. Auth is handled automatically.

**Discovery first.** If you're not sure of the path, call `{"action":"endpoints","filter":"<keyword>"}` (e.g. filter='calendar' or 'gallery' or 'theme') to list available endpoints with their methods + summaries. Then call with action='call'.

**Common surfaces (use `endpoints` with filter to discover the full set per domain):**
- Calendar: `/api/calendar/events`, `/api/calendar/calendars`, `/api/calendar/events/{uid}`
- Cookbook: `/api/cookbook/gpus`, `/api/cookbook/state`, `/api/cookbook/setup`, `/api/cookbook/packages`, `/api/cookbook/hf-latest`, `/api/model/cached`. Do NOT use `app_api` for package installs, engine rebuilds, or PID signalling.
- Gallery: `/api/gallery/list`, `/api/gallery/delete`, `/api/gallery/{id}`, `/api/gallery/albums`
- Library / Documents: list all via `/api/documents/library`; docs in a session via `/api/documents/{session_id}`; a single doc via `/api/document/{id}` (singular) and its history via `/api/document/{id}/versions` (singular). Note the plural `/api/documents/...` vs singular `/api/document/{id}` split.
- Memory: `/api/memory`, `/api/memory/{id}`, `/api/memory/search`
- Notes: `/api/notes`, `/api/notes/{id}`
- Tasks: `/api/tasks`, `/api/tasks/{id}/run`, `/api/tasks/notifications`
- Sessions: `/api/sessions`, `/api/session/{id}`, `/api/session/{id}/truncate`
- Themes: `/api/prefs/themes`, `/api/prefs/custom-themes`
- Settings: `/api/settings`, `/api/prefs/{key}`
- Research: `/api/research/start`, `/api/research/tasks` (note: `/api/research/report/{id}` renders HTML — to READ a report's text use the `manage_research` tool with `action:read`, not this endpoint)
- Compare: `/api/compare/sessions`, `/api/compare/start`
- Email: use named email tools (`list_email_accounts`, `list_emails`, `read_email`, `send_email`, `reply_to_email`). Do NOT use `/api/email/accounts`; it is owner-filtered in tool context and may falsely return empty.
- Endpoints (model providers): `/api/endpoints`, `/api/endpoints/{id}`
- Shell: do NOT use `app_api` for `/api/shell/*`; use named command tooling instead.

Body for POST/PUT/PATCH goes in `body` (object). Query params in `query` (object). Returns the parsed JSON of the response.

**When to prefer named tools over app_api:** if a named wrapper exists (list_email_accounts, list_emails, read_email, manage_calendar, manage_notes, list_served_models, etc.) USE IT — it has nicer output formatting and clearer schema. Reach for `app_api` only when there's no wrapper for what you need.

# blocker, robust even on strong models). These phases exist to be DRIVEN FORWARD:

# advancing (the owner's call: keep the dynamic DM, error-correct the omission).

# is "jury"), so "finale" — not "jury-finale" (a MOMENT, never a phase) — is what belongs here.
# The old "jury-finale" entry was dead (it never matched a phase), leaving the L39 forced-advance
# backstop blind to the long staged finale where the model most reliably under-calls advanceGame.
# Double-advance is prevented by the `_pre_resolved` gate on the backstop below: the pre-resolve

# may have NARRATED an outcome it never read from the engine (the #1 desync). Now that the OOB narrator
# is GLM-4.7 (ADR 0016 / PR #1151), whose tool-calling rides interleaved thinking and which HONORS
# `tool_choice` (DeepSeek-V4 rejected `required` in always-thinking mode — the structural root of the
# old ~0% spontaneous-call rate), we can GUARANTEE the call PROACTIVELY at the closed-set beats where a
# miss is catastrophic, by forcing it on the wire. This is ADDITIVE: spontaneous interleaved calling
# stays primary on every ordinary turn (forcing every turn is wasteful and would flatten free narration),
# the forced call is the guarantee at the few beats below, and the reactive belts remain the third net.
#
# The mandate guardrail (engine never speaks for the player): we force ONLY the ENGINE-OWNED,
# deterministic beats whose result is the engine's to compute and the model's only to VOICE —
# runCompetition (read the already-decided comp winner) and advanceGame (drip the next deterministic
# ceremony/eviction beat). We NEVER force submitDecision: that tool carries the PLAYER's explicit pick
# ("never infer a binding choice from prose"), so forcing it would make the model invent a binding

# model must surface the card and wait, which the pending-barrier framing already pins).

# is already in progress (`peekCompetition` just re-reports the fixed winner, never advancing the

# without ever revealing the next round: the staged play-by-play silently never surfaced. `advanceGame`

      • framed_beat_key  — the beat the model is grounded on THIS turn (`_LAST_FRAMED_BEAT_KEY[owner]`,
        a (week, phase, moment[, pendingKind]) tuple); phase at index 1, moment at index 2.
      • turn_tool_names  — the set of engine tool NAMES already fired THIS turn (from tool_events). The
        beat's tool having ALREADY fired this turn ⇒ the guarantee is met ⇒ do NOT re-force (which would
        fight the model on a later round of a multi-round turn).
      • pending_open     — True iff the engine has an OPEN player pending. Any open pending SUPPRESSES
        forcing: the engine waits on the PLAYER (a card), and the model must surface it, not advance or
        run a comp past it. (We never force submitDecision — see the block comment above.)

    Precedence: a comp phase forces a NAMED advanceGame directly (never a bare `"required"`) whenever
    `advanceGame` hasn't fired yet this round. #1319: `runCompetition` is a genuine NO-OP once a staged
    competition is already in progress — `peekCompetition` (liveSeason.ts) re-reports the SAME fixed
    winner without touching `stillIn`/`eliminated`, so it never reveals the next drop batch. The prior
    `"required"` choice let the model satisfy the guarantee by calling that dead-end preview instead of
    `advanceGame`; if a turn's internal round budget didn't allow the follow-up escalation round, the
    turn ended having "read the winner" without ever revealing a round — the staged reveals silently
    never surfaced (zero play-by-play) while the model narrated around the gap, until a later turn's
    advanceGame call landed on a stale expectedBeatSeq. Forcing the NAMED call directly closes that gap:
    `advanceGame` alone is always sufficient at this phase (it resolves the field on first entry AND
    reveals the next batch mid-reveal — the one call an in-progress comp ever needs), so every forced
    attempt now guarantees real progression, one batch per turn, until the crown. A non-comp ceremony
    advance-phase that hasn't advanced yet → force a named advanceGame (unchanged).

    J-3 fix (ceremony one-beat-per-turn guard, root (a)): `chat_helpers` overrides the framed MOMENT
    away from the raw `phase` in exactly two cases — the social-runway HOLD (`_hold_for_social`, moment
    → "social" while `phase` stays whatever unresolved ceremony is next) and the witnessed-ceremony
    override (`_with_moment(new_state, "nominations")`, moment → "nominations" after the engine has
    already self-advanced `phase` to the NEXT beat, e.g. "veto-competition" — NARR-7). Forcing off the
    raw `phase` in either case is phase-blind to the override and re-opens the exact force-march those
    overrides exist to prevent: a held social beat gets force-advanced past the player's lingering, or a
    just-witnessed ceremony gets force-dragged toward the NEXT phase's requirement instead of being
    narrated. So: a "social" moment always suppresses forcing, and a moment that is itself one of the
    ceremony-advance beats but does NOT match the (already-rolled) phase also suppresses — the model
    already has everything it needs to narrate that beat; forcing would only chase the phase ahead of it.

# ── 0065 Part A — CAS-guard the FE-issued BACK-FILL mutating calls ────────────────────────────── #
#
# The progression calls (advanceGame/submitDecision) already carry the compare-and-swap `beatSeq`
# token. This wires the same token onto the FE-issued BACK-FILL mutations — `recordInteraction`,
# `makeDeal`, `moveTo` (the `_auto_record_scene`/`_auto_record_deal`/`_auto_move_player` belts) — the
# 0065 Part A tail that the A/B integration deferred as a "documented future refinement".
#
# These differ from the progression case and need CARE:
#   • They fire MID-TURN, often AFTER other mutations (the pre-resolve advance, a model-driven record)
#     already bumped beatSeq. So the SELF-409 risk is real: if we attached a stale last-seen token we
#     would 409 our own back-fill on a perfectly normal turn. We defeat that by refreshing last-seen
#     from EVERY response (`_refresh_beat_seq`) — every read and every mutation, including these ones.
#   • On a stale 409 the engine threw `StaleBeatError` BEFORE any mutation/fold (fail-closed, at-most-
#     once — see issue #591 / A-S3): the write provably did not land. So a RE-ATTEMPT against the
#     refreshed `beatSeq` is SAFE and cannot double-apply. For `recordInteraction` the back-fill is
#     frequently the SOLE record of a player↔NPC scene, so SKIPPING it on a 409 silently EVAPORATES that
#     scene's only consequence fold (mandate #4 / ADR-0005 #4 — "a novel move must never evaporate").
#     So we now RE-ATTEMPT once against the reconciled token rather than skip. A second consecutive 409
#     (the board moved AGAIN under the retry) used to reconcile-and-skip — audit CON-11 (corroborating
#     the standing R-A-S3 latent) found that under SUSTAINED two-window concurrency this still silently
#     evaporates a fold-bearing scene, so a fold-bearing call (`defer_fold=True`) now DEFERS to a tiny
#     bounded per-owner retry queue (`chat_helpers._defer_fold`/`_drain_deferred_folds`) instead of
#     dropping it — the loss is bounded to LATENCY (it lands on the next opportunity), never DATA. A
#     non-fold-bearing call (the default — e.g. `moveTo`, a purely positional belt with no hidden
#     relationship impact to lose) keeps the prior reconcile-and-skip behavior: re-deriving a stale
#     LOCATION from a much-later board would be actively wrong in a way a late-landing memory fold is not.
async def _backfill_with_cas(owner, fn, *args, defer_fold: bool = False, **kwargs):
    """Issue an FE back-fill mutating engine call (`record_interaction`/`make_deal`/`move_to`/`confide`/
    `expose_secret`/`trade_secret`) with the 0065 Part A compare-and-swap token attached, refreshing
    last-seen from its response.

    On a stale 409 the engine refused the write BEFORE folding (fail-closed), so we reconcile to the
    fresh `beatSeq` (`_handle_stale_beat`) and RE-ATTEMPT the same mutation ONCE against it — issue #591:
    a `recordInteraction` back-fill is often a scene's only consequence fold and must not evaporate, and
    the pre-write throw makes a single retry double-apply-safe.

    A second consecutive stale 409 (the board moved AGAIN under the retry — audit CON-11, a genuine
    risk under sustained two-window concurrency): when `defer_fold=True` (the call carries a hidden
    relationship impact that must never evaporate — mandate #4), the call is QUEUED for opportunistic
    retry (`chat_helpers._defer_fold`) rather than dropped — it lands late, not never, and can never
    double-apply (each retry re-attaches the freshest CAS token). When `defer_fold=False` (the default —
    a purely positional/physical belt like `moveTo` with no fold to lose), it reconciles-and-skips as
    before (re-derivable next turn).

    Returns the engine response dict on success, or None when the write could not land THIS call (a
    second stale 409 — deferred for later if `defer_fold`, dropped otherwise — or a None retry result).
    Re-raises any NON-stale error so the caller's own fail-closed `except` handles it exactly as today.

    Why this is safe (the no-self-409 contract): last-seen is refreshed from EVERY engine response this
    turn (reads AND mutations), so the token attached here is the freshest the FE has seen — a normal
    turn never 409s itself. A stale 409 means a genuine concurrent move (another device / the 0064
    queued-turn case), which we reconcile and re-attempt once before deferring/giving up."""

# because the model invents positions instead of grounding to the engine. The engine grounding
# shipped (whereabouts() in the per-turn context; the player is PINNED and only an explicit
# `moveTo` relocates them). But just like recordInteraction/advanceGame, the model reliably
# UNDER-calls `moveTo`: the player says "I head to the kitchen", the narrator voices the kitchen,
# but never moves the engine — so next turn whereabouts still reports the OLD room and the picture
# snaps back ("you're still in the kitchen" after you moved to the living room). So when the
# player's turn clearly walked them somewhere and the model did NOT call moveTo, the FE GUARANTEES
# the move: a constrained extraction proposes the destination room and we call move_to ourselves,
# PERSISTING the player's room so the whereabouts picture stays consistent turn-to-turn.

    move. The model OWNS the magnitude; we only supply a direction-correct kind it proposed.

    ADR 0005 — the extraction MAY ALSO propose a richer `consequence` descriptor (which edges move,
    which way, relative emphasis only, and why) for a scene that moves houseguests in DIFFERENT
    directions. It is the generative-mapping payoff for this error-correction path. The descriptor is
    validated against the roster and the closed direction/emphasis enums (`_validate_consequence`);

    `aboutEdges`: a THIRD-PARTY pitch, the classic "I told Lorenzo that Maeve is the real threat"
    move that `edges` alone cannot express (edges only move a houseguest's opinion of the INITIATOR).

    and refuses it outright if the named holder never witnessed the scene. Never engine-authored
    content: this only fires when the model's OWN narration already implied the pitch and the model
    skipped recording it.

# ── 0075 — the trust-gated CONFIDE under-call belt (the _auto_record_scene / _auto_record_deal sibling) ──
#
# The narration model reliably UNDER-calls `confide`: it voices a houseguest opening up — or the player
# pressing them to ("what's really going on with you?", "you can tell me", "talk to me") — without ever
# calling the engine `confide(npcId)` lever, so the trust-gated disclosure NEVER FIRES (no earned secret,
# no lie, no vulnerability fold). The engine is fine; the model just skips the call (exactly the 0055 /
# 0039 class). So when the player's turn is clearly PRESSING an ally to open up and the model did not call
# `confide`, the FE calls it itself — and the ENGINE adjudicates (`disclosureMotive` decides whether they
# disclose, how much, and truth-vs-lie). If the bond/goodwill is unearned the engine returns
# `{disclosed:false}` HARMLESSLY — the safe default — so a false trip costs nothing. We NEVER engine-author
# a confession; the engine is the single authority (mandate #2 / anti-sycophancy). Model-driven `confide`
# always takes precedence. Player↔ONE-houseguest only (the confide shape).
#
# We do NOT depend on `npcVoice.mayConfide` — it is NOT surfaced to the FE. We detect the press from the
# player's OWN line (a cheap pre-filter) and let the constrained extraction pick the ally in the scene.
#
# A deliberately BROAD pre-filter over the PLAYER'S line — pressing-to-open-up language is varied ("what's
# really going on", "you can trust me", "talk to me", "what aren't you telling me", "open up", "between
# us"). A missed signal means a silently-dropped earned confidence; a false hit only costs a rare
# extraction call that returns npcId:null AND, even if it named someone, a `{disclosed:false}` engine
# no-op. So we err wide and let the extraction + the engine's motive gate be the real gatekeepers.

# ── 0093/0099 — the EXPOSE / TRADE secret under-call belts (the _auto_confide sibling) ──────────
#
# `exposeSecret`/`tradeSecret` are ALREADY fully built, wired engine tools (registry → McpServer →
# GameSessionAdapter) — but the narration model reliably UNDER-calls them: it voices the player
# outing a rival's secret to the house, or bartering a secret for a favor, without ever calling the
# lever, so the marquee offense move NEVER FIRES (no standing fold, no exposer backlash, no `told-by`
# pathway record). The engine is fine; the model just skips the call (exactly the 0055/0075 class).
# So when the player's OWN line clearly reads as outing or trading a secret and the model did NOT
# call the lever, the FE calls it itself — and the ENGINE adjudicates (whether it lands, whether the
# recipient bites; anti-sycophancy/I2, mirroring how `exposeSecret`/`confide` already work).
#
# I3/Vault Wall: we NEVER invent a secret. The candidate `factId` is drawn ONLY from the player's OWN
# CURRENTLY-KNOWN facts (`getVisibleStateFor`'s `knowledge` — Vault-free by construction, the same
# projection the player already reads), and the constrained extraction may ONLY pick an id from that
# list or reply null. The engine's own `resolveWieldedSecret` bright line re-validates ownership
# regardless (a non-learned/spent fact is REJECTED) — this is defense-in-depth, not the only guard.
# Model-driven `exposeSecret`/`tradeSecret` always take precedence; this only fills a genuine gap.
