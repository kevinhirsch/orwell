"""Feature 0116 (phase 2 of the casting upgrade) — the FE model-authoring DRIVER for model-authored
cast GENESIS. Phase 1 (orwell_cast_authoring) re-routes the DEPTH to the model; this drives the
SKELETON itself: the producer-LLM proposes the ENTIRE 15-NPC cast — names, freeform identities,
personas, hidden elements, banded stats, and the pre-show tie graph — and the ENGINE validates,
clamps, repairs, and commits it inside an envelope it owns (``recordCastGenesis`` →
``src/engine/castGenesis.ts``, already shipped). Mirrors the sibling write-back drivers:

    engine pre-seeds the player-INDEPENDENT deterministic FLOOR cast (preSeedCast) + returns the
      Vault-free roster ids
      → THIS module: the producer-LLM proposes the WHOLE skeleton, steered ONLY by a seeded
        season brief (player-BLIND), as strict JSON
      → recordCastGenesis writes it back; the ENGINE validates the proposal against its envelope
        (banded stat clamp — no model number escapes; the cast-wide variance floor; name validators;
        the closed hidden-element kinds + C9 gates; tie-graph sanity; hidden-game-weight stripping),
        folds the committed skeleton onto the byte-stable warmed cast, and seals the hidden half
      → structured, Vault-free violations come back; a bounded re-roll (≤GENESIS_MAX_REROLLS) echoes
        the re-roll violations to the model and re-proposes.
      → only THEN do the 0063 identity seed + the phase-1 deep authoring run (pipeline order:
        SKELETON → identity → author → shoot), each reading the genesis-committed ground truth.

THE HARD BOUNDARY (mandate #3 anti-sycophancy + mandate #2 Vault Wall):
  * genesis is PLAYER-BLIND by construction — NOTHING about the player crosses into the sketch prompt
    (a structural gate over the assembled prompt, §8), so the cast cannot be bent toward a player it
    never saw; the engine's post-hoc near-duplicate nudge catches an accidental collision;
  * the model proposes ONLY descriptive identity + BANDED stats — NEVER a hidden game weight (influence,
    trigger arming/volatility, the Day-1 read of the player, soul baselines, showmance seeds, every
    magnitude stay engine-seeded off the committed cast). No model number escapes the engine's clamp;
  * the model NEVER seals anything — the engine owns the wall + the guarantee. This module only
    proposes + forwards; the private orientation is re-sealed engine-side.

Deterministic FLOOR is byte-neutral: no model / a failed call / garbage output ⇒ no proposal ⇒ the
engine's deterministic factory simply stands (the fail-soft write-back contract that keeps the stubbed
lanes + the golden replay byte-identical, §7). Under the DEFAULT ``strict`` enrichment policy a failure
is LOUD (an ERROR + an admin-visible ledger entry + the strict-failed latch the loud pre-finalize gate
reads, §4 / #1313 precedent); under ``soft`` it is the legacy silent no-op.

Design: the orchestrator (``seed_cast_genesis``) takes INJECTED ``llm_fn`` + ``write_fn``, so the whole
pipeline is unit-testable without a live model or engine. ``run_genesis`` wires the real deps and is
awaited inside the pre-warm author lane (``orwell_prewarm.prewarm_cast``) BEFORE identity + authoring —
genesis is a PRE-GAME operation (``recordCastGenesis`` is refused once the season runs), so it rides the
pre-warm that overlaps the casting interview and is done by finalize; game start never blocks on it.
