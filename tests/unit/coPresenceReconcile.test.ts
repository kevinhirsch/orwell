/**
 * BL-014 — CO-PRESENCE RECONCILIATION (the fix dropped from PR #1721 for fighting the beatSeq spine +
 * the M0-9 seating-freeze; rebuilt ENGINE-SIDE). The model / FE belts (`_auto_record_scene`, the E22
 * fallback) can name a `withIds` participant the engine's OWN occupancy places in a DIFFERENT room — a
 * PHANTOM co-presence. Recorded, it makes engine truth internally inconsistent (the EventStore says they
 * witnessed a scene presence says they weren't in), and that contradiction re-injects on every recall +
 * relationship fold — a non-degradation breach we must NOT persist. `recordInteraction` reconciles at the
 * fold boundary: when the scene is GROUNDED (occupancy known AND the initiator has a room), drop any
 * caller-named non-player witness the occupancy positively places elsewhere, BEFORE the witness set / the
 * directed relationship fold / the premiere hot-read read it — never the player or the initiator, and
 * failing OPEN (no provider / placeless / unplaced initiator ⇒ keep everyone, so a presence hiccup never
 * zeroes the 0055 consequence-recording safety net). Roles only (no names — testing rule).
