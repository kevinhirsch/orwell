// TEST-3 (#628) — the spec-only shelf meta-test. `docs/features/*.feature` files read as executable
// contracts, but only the ones listed in `cucumber.cjs` `paths` actually execute as Gherkin (that
// file is the canonical list of what is wired into the BDD gate). Every OTHER .feature is gated
// elsewhere (FE pytest / unit / CI jobs — see docs/features/README.md) and must SAY so with an
// explicit `# spec-only:` marker at the top, so nobody mistakes an un-executed contract for a gate.
// This test pins the shelf against drift in BOTH directions:
//   1. every cucumber.cjs path exists on disk (no dead BDD-gate entries),
//   2. every wired feature does NOT carry the spec-only marker (a wired contract must not disclaim),
//   3. every unwired feature DOES carry it (a new .feature either joins cucumber.cjs or is shelved
//      explicitly — silently un-executed contracts can no longer accumulate).
