/**
 * #1320 — the HOH→nominations NIGHT-GATE (ADR 0006 pacing, the "deeper half" of the fast-forward fix,
 * PR #1309/#1320). The DEDICATED calibration-neutrality gate — the `perConversationClockNeutral` /
 * `stagedTrajectoryNeutral` sibling; replicate-never-skip (the SOUL minimum build bar).
 *
 * The gate inserts a diegetic `day-break` beat BETWEEN the HOH crown and the nominations, so nominations
 * land the NEXT in-fiction day (Day-1-HOH → Day-2-noms cadence) instead of the same moment as the crown.
 * It is GATED behind the clock pacing (`perConversationClockEnabled && timeOfDayEnabled` — the same pair
 * the per-conversation clock rides). The load-bearing claims:
 *
 *   • BYTE-IDENTICAL WHEN THE MASTER CLOCK IS OFF (the calibration spine — the EXACT state the
 *     juryReach/gradient/UAT sims run in): the night-gate can NEVER fire, no `day-break` beat is ever
 *     emitted, and the seeded competition/vote/jury OUTCOME stream is byte-identical. Master clock off
 *     gates it, so it can never perturb the calibration band.
 *   • NON-VACUOUS + PRESENTATION-ONLY when the clock is running: a `day-break` beat DOES fire, seated
 *     strictly between the HOH crown and the nominations, crossing the night to a fresh morning — and it
 *     is INERT (no rng draw), so it never re-phases the seeded stream.
 *
 * Roles only — no names; all fixtures generated.
