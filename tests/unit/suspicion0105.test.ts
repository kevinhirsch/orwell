/**
 * Feature 0105 — the Vault-safe suspicion a houseguest's DRIVE (0086) gives them. Roles only (a schemer,
 * a rival, a safe floater). The PURE `driveSuspicion` maps a threat-reading drive to a behavioral hunch;
 * the live `npcVoice` surfaces it on `suspects` ONLY when the drive layer is on (⇒ byte-identical
 * projection when off) and NEVER leaks the plan, the intensity, or a stated motive.
