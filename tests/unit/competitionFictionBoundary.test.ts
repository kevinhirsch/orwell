/**
 * Feature #1400 — the generative-competition write-back BOUNDARY test (the mandatory step-4 gate; the
 * `worldSnapshotBoundary`/`castPrewarm` template). The engine has a COMPLETE adapter impl
 * (`competitionStagingView` / `recordCompetitionFiction`), but the four-place wiring is DEAD at runtime
 * unless the tool is BOTH on the channel allowlist AND dispatched in `McpServer.callTool` — and neither
 * the arch gate nor the manifest test catches a missing dispatch case. This proves the seam is open end
 * to end: the FE can reach the staging READ and the fiction WRITE-BACK over the MCP boundary. It also
 * pins the core SAFETY property: a matched fiction is accepted, a REORDERED one is rejected (the 0042
 * floor stands). Roles only — no names from any corpus.
