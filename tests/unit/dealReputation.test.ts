/**
 * 0121 R1 — the diffusing "keeps their word" REPUTATION reward (the knowledge-belief design). A kept deal
 * seeds a hidden `reliable:<honorer>` belief that spreads NPC→NPC; the DEAL consequence is an explicit,
 * bounded deal-willingness lean read from that belief (`mintNpcDeal`), and a small AFFINITY-ONLY whisper
 * makes reliable players faintly more liked — kept OFF the deal-trust read so the two never double-count.
 * Gated behind the deal-depth layer (off ⇒ never seeded ⇒ byte-identical). Roles only — an
 * "honorer"/"other"/"third party" are structural roles, no names.
