/**
 * TCG-16 — the "four-place write-back" wiring gotcha (CLAUDE.md's own build brief) keeps recurring: a
 * port method ships fully implemented in the adapter (steps 1-2) but is never added to the registry
 * allowlist or given a `McpServer.callTool` dispatch case (steps 3-4), so it is DEAD at runtime with
 * nothing failing — dependency-cruiser only checks Vault edges, and the lever-manifest drift test only
 * checks prose. `worldSnapshotView` (BE-103) is the latest confirmed instance, found only by a manual
 * audit pass, not by any test. This file is the standing structural gate the audit (TCG-16) asked for:
 * it walks EVERY method on the `GameSession`/`EngineCommands` ports and proves each is BOTH (a)
 * registered on an outward tool allowlist and (b) has a real dispatch case in `McpServer.callTool` — so
 * the NEXT `worldSnapshotView`-shaped gap fails `npm test`, not a future audit.
 *
 * TypeScript has no runtime reflection over an `interface` (no `keyof` survives to runtime). The
 * `Record<keyof T, true>` literals below are the practical substitute: TypeScript itself refuses to
 * compile this file if the port GAINS or LOSES a method and this list is not updated in lockstep (a
 * missing key is a compile error; an extra/unknown key is also a compile error) — an even EARLIER gate
 * than a failing test, since `npm run typecheck` runs before a single test executes.
