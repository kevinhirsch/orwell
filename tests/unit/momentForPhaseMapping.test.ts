// Batch C gate #5 (2026-07-11 narrator-prompt audit) — momentForPhase MAPPING AUDIT.
//
// The gap the audit found (finding 7): `momentForPhase` routed the Final-3 `final-eviction` phase
// through its `includes("evict")` fall-through to the ordinary `eviction` fragment — which scripts
// the SECRET-BALLOT staged drip (read ONE anonymized ballot per turn, build the count…). But the
// final eviction is NOTHING like that: the final HOH casts the SOLE, OPEN deciding vote — no ballot,
// no drip, no tally. So the narrator was handed a fragment whose mechanics were WRONG for the beat.
//
// This table-driven gate pins each structural phase to the fragment it maps to AND asserts that
// fragment's mechanics claims actually HOLD for that beat — so a mapping that lands a beat on a
// fragment describing the wrong ceremony fails here.
