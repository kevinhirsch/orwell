/**
 * Feature 0101 (#1401) — the AI SHOWRUNNER's CLOSED-SET NEUTRALITY GATE (the `*OutcomeNeutral.test.ts`
 * sibling — trajectory / secretBarter / staged). The showrunner re-weights only the OPEN set (which
 * simmering thread the off-screen tick emphasizes); it must be PROVABLY inert to the CLOSED set (every
 * competition roll, eligibility rule, and vote tally). This is airtight BY CONSTRUCTION and proven here:
 *
 *   • The note is composed on a PURE pass (`showrunnerTick`, no rng).
 *   • The scheduler it biases runs on per-thread SIDE rngs (keyed by thread id) — the shared `rng` it is
 *     handed is never consumed — and a surfacing's downstream work runs on DEDICATED rngs / no rng
 *     (`onThreadGossip` forks its own; `onThreadSurfaceToPlayer` draws nothing).
 *
 * So with the flag ON or OFF: (A) the shared off-screen draw stream through the whole tick is
 * byte-identical, and (B) a FULL seeded season's competition/eviction/vote outcomes hash identically.
 * DEFAULT OFF ⇒ nothing composed at all. HARD rule: roles only — no names.
