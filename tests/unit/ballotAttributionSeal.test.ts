/**
 * Ship-blocker A7 — eviction votes are SECRET BALLOTS (E12): the staged reveal only ever carries
 * anonymized ballots ("a vote to evict …"); per-voter attribution unseals ONLY in the 0048
 * post-season retrospective. `reconcileDeals` and `reconcileAllianceBetrayals` (GameSessionAdapter)
 * separately minted a player-witnessed event NAMING the breaker whenever the triggering binding
 * action was a `vote-evict` — deanonymizing that houseguest's ballot the moment the deal/alliance
 * broke, well before the retrospective. This file proves the seal: the fact that a deal/alliance
 * broke reaches the player (a Vault-safe, unattributed signal), but the specific voter's identity —
 * tied to the sealed ballot — stays Vault-held until the season finishes and the SAME terminal gate
 * the primary eviction reveal already uses lifts it.
 *
 * HARD rule: roles only — the player, an NPC voter, a deal partner. No names.
