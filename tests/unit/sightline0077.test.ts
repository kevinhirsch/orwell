 * Feature 0077 Phase 2 — the SIGHTLINE graph (eyeshot). Adjacency is who you can WALK to; sightline is
 * whose occupants you can SEE. The HARD invariants: the graph is symmetric + irreflexive; the OPEN
 * PUBLIC CORE (kitchen/living-room/dining-room/backyard) is a mutual-visibility CLIQUE; the living room
 * sees into the hallway mouth; and EVERY closed door (the three bedrooms, bathroom, lounge, HOH, storage,
 * diary) is opaque from outside — crucially, the hallway sees NONE of the bedrooms it adjoins. Roles
 * only; pure data, no rng.
