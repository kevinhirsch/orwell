/**
 * Lane 8 / audit E8 — save-write durability. The atomic temp+rename (B35/E2) protects against a
 * CRASH; a truncated file must never be "latest". The load-bearing guarantee is fsync(the file's
 * CONTENT) BEFORE the rename: a power cut then either loses the rename (the prior COMPLETE version
 * stays latest) or keeps it (the content was already flushed) — never a truncated winner. That
 * ordering is the contract — pinned here by instrumenting the real fs calls the store makes (the
 * writes still hit the real filesystem).
 *
 * F-EN-1 (#1562): the SECOND fsync — the DIRECTORY fsync AFTER the rename — only hardens the rename's
 * directory ENTRY against a sudden power loss (natural page-cache writeback makes it durable within
 * seconds anyway), and it is a blocking fsync on the single Node thread on the hot per-turn commit
 * path that stalls every concurrent user. Because a truncated file can never win (content fsync
 * above), it is AMORTIZED to the periodic checkpoint cadence (every CHECKPOINT_EVERY-th version):
 * a per-turn save no longer pays it, the long-lived checkpoint renames still get the hard power-loss
 * guarantee, and a power cut loses at most the recent un-hardened tail. Pinned below.
 *
 * Roles only — no names.
