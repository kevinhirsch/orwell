/**
 * #1106 follow-through — the integrity circuit's SEMANTICS (issue ask (a), audit E7 completed).
 *
 * The breaker (B58/E6) exists to stop off-screen ticks from BLINDLY RETRYING a deterministic
 * state-integrity fault, and it doubles as God Mode's "state corrupted repeatedly" alarm. E7 split
 * `persist-failure` into its own fault class so a disk failure is never misread as degradation —
 * but the breaker still counted BOTH kinds in one streak, so N transient I/O blips lit the same
 * corruption alarm a real degradation burst does. These tests pin the completed split:
 *
 *   - N consecutive persist-failures (clean state, sick disk) NEVER open the circuit — each is
 *     still fail-closed (rolled back, typed, recorded in health);
 *   - a persist blip neither ADVANCES nor RESETS a real corruption streak;
 *   - real corruption still opens the circuit at BREAKER_THRESHOLD, a read-only AUDIT cannot
 *     close it (#1380 review — it compares the rolled-back baseline to itself and proves nothing
 *     about the sandbox's ability to COMMIT), and a clean player-turn commit closes it;
 *   - a SUPPLEMENTARY-TICK save failure is contained: the already-committed player turn STANDS
 *     (no throw, no FE retry bait, no raw ENOSPC path crossing the boundary), the tick rolls back
 *     so memory matches the durable save, and the fault is recorded as persist-failure;
 *   - the recent-fault ring SURVIVES the next clean commit (#1106's forensics were minable only
 *     from stderr; now God Mode's health keeps the capped ring).
 *
 * HARD rule: roles only — no names (the player fixture is the bare role placeholder "P").
