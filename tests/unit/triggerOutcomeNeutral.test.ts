/**
 * Feature 0091 — the CALIBRATION-NEUTRALITY GATE (the `trajectoryOutcomeNeutral` / `stagedTrajectoryNeutral`
 * sibling). The load-bearing determinism guarantee is bipartite (mandate #3 + the spec's determinism callout):
 *
 *   • The trigger check draws ONLY on its own DEDICATED session rng, NEVER the shared off-screen stream that
 *     drives the seeded society/competition/vote spine. So within a tick the society's seeded output is
 *     byte-IDENTICAL whether the layer is OFF or ON (the check runs AFTER the society, on a separate rng).
 *   • Flag OFF (the DEFAULT — the state the juryReach/UAT/gradient calibration sims run in) ⇒ the orchestrator
 *     never runs the trigger check ⇒ ZERO draws on ANY rng (the dedicated trigger-rng tick counter never
 *     advances) ⇒ the run is a byte-identical deterministic fixed point.
 *   • The HOUSE-GENERATION main stream stays byte-stable: arming runs on a dedicated `:trigger:` side rng, so
 *     stats/names/ages/souls (the calibration inputs) are byte-identical whether or not a trigger is armed.
 *
 * NOTE (by design, NOT asserted): with the layer ON the eruption's soul/witness FOLDS legitimately MOVE reads
 * (the same kind of fold the society already applies), so relationship EDGES / vote OUTCOMES may differ ON vs
 * OFF. That is fine — the calibration harness runs with the flag OFF (proven byte-identical here + by the
 * `tests/property/juryReach.property.test.ts` heavy gate), and the RNG STREAM the comps/votes resolve on is
 * untouched (proven by the identical SHARED-event stream below).
 *
 * HARD rule: roles only — no names; all fixtures generated.
