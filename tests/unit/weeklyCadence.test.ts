/**
 * 0066 (#1125) — the weekly 5-cycle cadence + period placement in the 24-hour model. One HOH reign:
 * HOH → nominations → veto draw + veto competition → veto ceremony → eviction, STRICT order, no default
 * rest days, the daily-event invariant. The HOH crowns in the MORNING (maximizing the post-HOH playable
 * window), the veto COMP runs in the AFTERNOON, the EVICTION is in the EVENING, and the next HOH begins the
 * MORNING AFTER the eviction (NOT eviction night). Roles only — beats, not names.
