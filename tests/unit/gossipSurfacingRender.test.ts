/**
 * PV2 (#997) — gossip / overhear SURFACING must render with a real, never-empty SOURCE and a GRADED
 * confidence vocabulary, not the flat literal that produced "(, muffled)" (empty source + one repeated
 * confidence word). The belief layer already computes graded, decaying confidence + provenance; this
 * pins that the PLAYER-FACING render reflects it across a real, multi-hop driven season.
 *
 * Roles only — the procedurally-generated cast is referenced by id, never by fixture name. The drive is
 * the orchestrator off-screen tick (the same path the live society/gossip/overhear loop runs on).
