/**
 * Narration-framing fixes from the 2026-06-26 BB-nerd auditor synthesis (Lane C).
 *
 * F3 (#1016) — archetypes told, not inferred. The roster line LED with the exact strategic label the
 *   prose rules forbid voicing, so the model led its narration with it. The fix DEMOTES archetype +
 *   strategyStyle into a fenced PRIVATE voice cue and LEADS the line with the OBSERVABLE facets.
 * F13 (#1018) — "Houseguest's Choice" chip not voiced. The veto-competition fragment now instructs the
 *   model to voice the chip draw as its own ritual beat, including the HGC special draw + who was picked.
 *
 * Roles only — no fixture names.
