 *
 * The engine decides the winner (`runCompetition`); the comp's PRESENTATION was model-authored and was
 * NOT held stable turn to turn — the Week-1 HOH comp narrated as "Piece by Piece" (a puzzle) on one beat
 * and "Center-Ring Trivia" (a quiz) the next, a full FORMAT flip-flop within one event. This proves the
 * fix: `competitionPresentation` — the single engine-side pin the ground truth surfaces on EVERY comp
 * beat — reports the SAME format + premise on the first reveal AND on every staged elimination round,
 * so the narrator can never re-author "what kind of comp this is". HARD rule: roles only — no names.
