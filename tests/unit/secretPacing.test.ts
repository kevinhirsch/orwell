/**
 * Feature 0092 — the SECRET-PACING DRIP. A thin, relationship-aware PACING layer over 0060: it decides
 * WHICH sealed secret is ripe to edge toward THIS player and WHETHER the weekly budget allows it, then
 * routes the top candidate into 0060's EXISTING anchored surface path (the confidant slip / gossip
 * chain). It adds no new pathway, surfaces nothing itself, and never reads the Vault to a surface. HARD
 * rule: roles only, no names. Determinism + the Vault Wall + the weekly/season caps are all asserted.
 *
 * The byte-identical-draw-stream neutrality (flag off ⇒ zero pacing draws ⇒ the seeded comp/vote/jury
 * spine is unchanged) lives in its OWN file (`secretPacingNeutral.test.ts`), the load-bearing gate.
