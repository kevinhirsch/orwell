/**
 * #1391 — the narrator-prompt token BUDGET regression gate.
 *
 * The 2026-07-11 narrator system-prompt audit (finding 12, P2) measured the fixed prompt at ≈17–20k
 * tokens/turn and found that per-rule compliance DECAYS with rulebook size — every added rule dilutes
 * the 60+ MUST/NEVER rules, worst on Flash-tier models. This gate FREEZES the post-dedup size so a
 * future edit can't SILENTLY re-bloat the fixed prompt: a new rule must either fit the (small)
 * headroom or force a CONSCIOUS re-baseline of the budget here, with a note on what earned the growth.
 *
 * This is a SIZE gate only — it does NOT pin rule CONTENT (that is owned by leverManifest.test.ts,
 * momentOrchestration.test.ts, momentFramingFixes.test.ts, …, which assert every load-bearing phrase
 * is present). The two gates are complementary: content says "the rule must exist"; this says "the
 * rulebook must stay tight".
 *
 * Budgets are in CHARACTERS. Tokens ≈ chars/4 (the ratio the audit itself used: BASE 43,406 chars ≈
 * 10.9k tok), so each char budget carries an approximate token budget in its comment. Every budget
 * sits only SLIGHTLY above the current measured size (~2% headroom) — tight enough that real bloat
 * trips it, loose enough that a trivial reword does not.
 *
 * TO RE-BASELINE (when a genuinely-needed addition lands): run
 *   npx vitest run tests/unit/promptBudget.test.ts
 * read the actual vs. expected in the failure, and bump the specific budget below — in the SAME PR,
 * with a one-line note on what the new tokens buy. Never widen a budget to sneak past this gate.
 *
 * Roles only; a FIXED seed keeps the assembled sizes deterministic (the cast facets are seed-derived).
