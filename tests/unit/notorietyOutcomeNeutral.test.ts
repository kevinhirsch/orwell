/**
 * Feature 0104 — the CALIBRATION-NEUTRALITY GATE (the `triggerOutcomeNeutral` / `stagedTrajectoryNeutral`
 * sibling; minimum build bar, SOUL.md lesson 22). The load-bearing determinism guarantee is bipartite:
 *
 *   • Notoriety is OPT-IN + DIEGETIC: a summary is folded ONLY when the player returns as the SAME
 *     character. With NO notoriety set (a fresh / new-character game) the `seedFirstImpressions` notoriety
 *     block is SKIPPED ENTIRELY — its dedicated `:notoriety` rng is never created/drawn — so the move-in
 *     edges AND the whole seeded competition/vote/jury OUTCOME STREAM are BYTE-IDENTICAL to a build with
 *     no notoriety. This is the state the juryReach/UAT/gradient calibration sims run in.
 *
 *   • The notoriety bias runs on a DEDICATED `:notoriety` sub-rng forked off the seed — NEVER the shared
 *     `:relationships` (move-in scatter) stream and NEVER any competition/vote stream. So even WITH a
 *     notoriety folded, every NPC↔NPC move-in edge is byte-identical and every competition/vote ROLL
 *     resolves on the identical rng stream (anti-sycophancy, mandate #3): notoriety touches ONLY the
 *     day-one NPC→player edges, never an outcome roll. A "veteran" never wins more than the seeded floor.
 *
 * HARD rule: roles only — no fixture names.
