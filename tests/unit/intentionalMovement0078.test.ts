/**
 * Feature 0078 Phase 1 — INTENTIONAL movement: NPCs move toward what their motivation points at (a
 * bond to build, a rival/target to work) and away from a pure threat, so co-presence is EARNED, not
 * arbitrary drift. The headline behavior is the measurable TREND toward the target; the load-bearing
 * safety property is that intent re-weights the existing draws WITHOUT adding any of its own (the
 * per-NPC draw count is unchanged — the calibration spine re-phases only by WHICH room intent steers
 * toward, which the seeded juryReach + gradient gates re-verify). Roles only — no names.
 *
 * Each fixture pins the TARGET in a fixed room (so it is in the occupancy the mover reads) and zeroes
 * affinity, isolating intent as the only steering force. The subject starts in the hallway — adjacent
 * to the lounge (a private room) — so the target's room is a legal one-step destination.

 * "earned co-presence" the feature is about. The bonus is bounded (steer, not force), so a strong test
 * weight is used to exercise the MECHANISM clearly; the calibrated magnitude (0.2) is the heavy sims' job.
