/**
 * Features 0093 + 0099 — DECEPTION is first-class (owner direction 2026-06-27). Any use may be truthful
 * OR a BLUFF, and BOTH NPCs and the player can lie. A bluff invents a claim, reads NOTHING from the Vault,
 * folds on BELIEF (trust × plausibility), and the engine NEVER tells the player whether it matched a
 * truth; a later contradicting genuine pathway delivers a betrayal-grade, recoverable hit to the bluffer
 * (the passive lie-catch). Roles only — no names; all fixtures generated.
