 * Feature 0077 — the recent-BB floor plan (movement layer; Phase 1). The HARD invariants from the spec:
 * the graph is symmetric, irreflexive and connected; the BATHROOM is NOT adjacent to any bedroom (owner
 * note #1 — it opens off the hallway); the diary room adjoins only the living room; and the PRIVATE WING
 * (the three bedrooms, bathroom, lounge) is reachable ONLY through the hallway chokepoint — so privacy is
 * impossible in the open public core and available behind the hallway. Roles only; pure data, no rng.
