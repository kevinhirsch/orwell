/**
 * BB-14 (2026-07-03 final-pre-ship audit, bb-nerd lane) — "No HOH-room reveal — 'Who wants to see
 * my HOH room?!', the letter from home, the basket" was missing entirely.
 *
 * The fix stages it as PURE NARRATION off the already-decided HOH crown — appended to the
 * `hoh-competition` moment-prompt fragment — with NO new structural beat. The first attempt added an
 * inert `hoh-reveal` beat, but a structural beat cannot be neutral here: in pure turn-driven mode the
 * orchestrator fires one bounded off-screen tick per loop-PROGRESSING advance (gated on the live-loop
 * state changing), so an extra beat draws an extra off-screen-society rng tick and shifts the seeded
 * calibration gradient. A prompt-only fragment cannot touch the loop, so it is neutral BY CONSTRUCTION
 * — the guard below proves the crown still hands straight off to `nominations`, adding no beat.
 * HARD rule: roles only — no names.
