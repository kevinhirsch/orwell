/**
 * T0-2 — "beats terminate themselves" (moonshot P1 stage 1 / #27a; `docs/audits/
 * 2026-07-21-campaign-report-and-exhaustive-backlog.md` DoR/AC/DoD). Resolving a CLOSED-SET ceremony
 * pending (`AUTO_ADVANCE_PENDING_KINDS` in `GameSessionAdapter.ts`) now auto-advances the live loop
 * ONE more deterministic step IN THE SAME committed transaction — `submitDecision` never leaves the
 * game sitting at "resolved, but nothing moved" waiting for a separate `advanceGame` call. Pendings
 * that carry the player's own expressive content (goodbye messages, the interactive finale…) keep
 * their CURRENT semantics — resolving them does NOT auto-advance.
 *
 * Games are driven through a real `composeRuntime` (not a bare `GameSessionAdapter`) because
 * `beatSeq` only bumps through the registry's commit funnel (0065 Part A) — the invariant this suite
 * exists to pin needs that funnel wired up, exactly like a live game.
 *
 * HERMETICITY (root-caused 2026-07-22, the #1825-engine-lane flake): a "seeded" live game is only
 * trajectory-deterministic if EVERY rng dimension it touches is pinned — the player's `gameSeed`
 * (via `createCharacter({ seed })`) pins CEREMONY beats (`GameSessionAdapter.beatRng`), but
 * `composeRuntime`'s per-turn off-screen tick is seeded PER SANDBOX USER
 * (`Orchestrator.rngFor`: `hashSeed(\`${orchestratorSeed}:${user}\`)`, by design — two different
 * users playing the same game-seed must not get identical off-screen scheming). `startedGame` below
 * previously minted a RANDOM username per call (`Math.random()`), so the off-screen society (which
 * folds into relationship/emotional state, which weighs INTO competition outcomes) drew a DIFFERENT
 * stream every run — occasionally shifting week 2's HOH winner and, downstream, whether the PLAYER
 * ever won HOH within the drive at all ("game finished before reaching a nominations pending",
 * intermittent, seed-independent — confirmed via a bare Node loop with no vitest involved, and
 * confirmed NOT caused by cross-test state: it reproduced with every OTHER test in this file
 * `.skip`'d). Every sandbox user string below is now a FIXED constant — never mint one from
 * `Math.random()`/`Date.now()`/anything non-deterministic in a trajectory-sensitive test.
 *
 * HARD rule: roles only — no fixture names asserted.
