/**
 * Feature 0101 (#1401) Phase-2 (#1455) — the AI SHOWRUNNER's OUTCOME-AFFECTING REWEIGHT.
 *
 * Phase-1 (`showrunnerOutcomeNeutral.test.ts`) proved the fold-free showrunner is SHA256-identical on/off.
 * Phase-2 is the STRONGER pacing: the producer note re-orders WHICH simmering thread wins the scheduler's
 * SCARCE per-tick slot (activate/surface — the transitions that FOLD hidden relationship weights that feed
 * the competition/vote spine), so it NECESSARILY perturbs the seeded outcome stream and CANNOT be
 * outcome-neutral by construction. It ships behind a DEDICATED sub-flag (`ORWELL_SHOWRUNNER_REWEIGHT`,
 * default OFF), gated by the calibration heavy-sims run ON (juryReach/gradient/UAT). This file proves the
 * pieces that DON'T need a full distribution:
 *
 *   (A) the pure reorder is a stable shortlist-first partition, respects `reweightSlots`, identity when off;
 *   (B) OFF ⇒ byte-identical (off-vs-today SHA256): a full season's closed-set outcomes hash identically
 *       whether the reweight flag is off with the Phase-1 showrunner off OR on — my code is inert when off;
 *   (C) ON ⇒ genuinely perturbs: the closed-set hash DIFFERS from OFF on ≥1 seed AND the monotonic
 *       reweight count is > 0 (non-vacuous), while the season still FINISHES normally;
 *   (D) the mandate BOUND holds ON: the hard season surfacing cap still binds (the reweight only re-orders
 *       which OPEN-SET storyline wins a bounded slot — it never bypasses a cap);
 *   (E) Vault-held ON: the reweight count / notes reach NO player- or admin-facing projection.
 *
 * HARD rule: roles only — no houseguest names.
