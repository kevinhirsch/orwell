/**
 * Phase 2 of "the player can play offense" (0085 follow-on) — wiring the PLAYER into the campaign
 * machinery: a LANDED evict-shaped pitch (`recordInteraction`'s `aboutEdges`, Phase 1) grows a real,
 * bounded, persistent campaign the player owns, mirroring `formCampaigns`/`advanceCampaign`/
 * `campaignTilt` so the player's offense reads on equal footing with an NPC's. Roles only (no names).
 *
 * Invariants under test:
 *  • `campaignActors()`/`formCampaigns()` still never form one FOR the player — only the player's own
 *    LANDED recorded move does (the spec's "never mind control" rule).
 *  • A backfired pitch grows nothing (I2 — a social move that fails moves nothing, campaign included).
 *  • Self-gated by the SAME `campaignsEnabled` flag as the rest of 0085 — off by default, byte-identical.
 *  • Bounded: progress accrues at most once per beat regardless of how many holders are pitched in one
 *    scene (the NPC-cadence parity bound flagged as a balance risk).
 *  • The resulting tilt feeds the SAME `campaignTiltFor`/`voteChoice` mechanism an NPC's campaign uses,
 *    and stays bounded to the SAME ceiling (`CAMPAIGN.base`) — never a stronger channel than an NPC's.
