/**
 * ENDGAME-4 (2026-07-03 final-pre-ship audit, endgame lane) — "No distinct WINNER moment — champion
 * and runner-up both get the generic 'post-season' reunion prompt." The season builds to winning Big
 * Brother, and the moment it happened the framing dropped straight to "host the reunion, offer the
 * recap" with zero distinction between winning and losing the finale.
 *
 * The fix is PRESENTATION ONLY: the `post-season` moment-prompt fragment (voiced on every post-finale
 * turn) now instructs the model to frame the crowning by the player's placement BEFORE hosting the
 * reunion — reading the fact the engine already injects verbatim (`playerSeason()` → "THE PLAYER'S OWN
 * SEASON: You WON the season." / "...RUNNER-UP..."). No engine state shape changed: `moment` stays
 * "post-season" (so every existing FE/engine consumer of that terminal signal is untouched), `finished`
 * and the winner are computed exactly as before — this file is the neutrality proof for that claim,
 * plus coverage that the crowning framing actually exists and is correctly ordered. Roles only.
