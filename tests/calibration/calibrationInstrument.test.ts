/**
 * CALIBRATION INSTRUMENT — data-gathering only (calibration revisit lane, 2026-06-19).
 *
 * The known game-feel concern: "passive players coast to Final 2 in ~half of seasons and then lose
 * there." The owner's decided approach is to INSTRUMENT AND GATHER DATA FIRST — quantify what is
 * actually happening before touching any tuning constant. This file is that instrument.
 *
 * It is NOT a gate. It changes NO calibration constant. It plays a configurable number of seeded
 * seasons under MULTIPLE player strategies (a PASSIVE coaster and an ACTIVE/strategic player) over
 * the SAME runtime composition `main.ts` uses (composeRuntime → registry → orchestrator commit
 * spine, pure turn-driven) and records structured per-season metrics:
 *   - the ladder reach (jury / F5 / F4 / F3 / F2 / win), read from the PUBLIC 0046 seat;
 *   - the player's PUBLIC competition wins (their visible resume);
 *   - the week the player's game was effectively decided (their eviction week, or the final week if
 *     they sat the Final 2);
 *   - the jury-vote margin at the finale (and by how much the player lost when they lost at F2);
 *   - how often the player BOTH reaches F2 AND loses there (the exact concern).
 *
 * It emits a machine-readable JSON artifact (`docs/audits/data/2026-06-19-calibration-data.json`)
 * plus feeds the written markdown analysis (`docs/audits/2026-06-19-calibration-data.md`).
 *
 * DETERMINISM: the two arms run over the SAME seeds, so any gap is a real, attributable effect of
 * play — never noise. The optional strategy-variation RNG draws from a DEDICATED hashSeed-forked
 * sub-stream (see `strategyRng`), so the engine's competition/vote RNG stream stays byte-identical
 * and the juryReach / gradient gates stay green (this isolation was the root cause of a prior
 * calibration regression — it is respected here).
 *
 * VAULT WALL: the instrument is engine-internal and reads ONLY Vault-free public projections
 * (`getGameState` / `advanceGame`). The artifact it writes is a dev/calibration doc — it is NOT
 * wired into any runtime player/admin surface. Roles only — no houseguest names in the metrics.
 *
 * Run it as a SINGLE bounded vitest file (never the heavy matrix):
 *   npx vitest run tests/calibration/calibrationInstrument.test.ts
