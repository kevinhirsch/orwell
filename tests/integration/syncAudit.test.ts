/**
 * tests/integration/syncAudit.test.ts
 *
 * The DETERMINISTIC half of the chat↔engine SYNC AUDIT (a standing CI regression gate).
 *
 * A recurring bug class in this product is chat↔engine DESYNC: the narration LLM asserts game
 * state the engine never produced (it narrates past a pending decision, invents nominees, or
 * voices a HOH/veto holder that disagrees with the board). We have shipped point fixes for the
 * symptoms (C-02 NPC pre-resolve, C-03 veto-draw grounding, the pending-decision barrier in
 * `frontend/routes/chat_helpers.py`). This file turns the ROOT CAUSE into a deterministic gate.
 *
 * CI cannot drive the real (non-deterministic, paid) model, so we do not test the narration. We
 * test the two things that PREVENT desync deterministically — and this is half #1:
 *
 *   The engine's FE-facing PROJECTIONS — `gameStatus()` (`PublicGameStatus`) and `getGameState()`
 *   (`GameStateView`) — are the model's GROUNDING SOURCES. They are what the narrator is handed to
 *   voice the real ceremony. If those two views ever DISAGREE on a shared fact, or go ill-formed,
 *   the narration can desync no matter how good the prompt is. So we drive a FULL season (several
 *   seeds, every player pending auto-resolved like the UAT / statusPending helpers) and, at EVERY
 *   beat, assert the projections are mutually consistent, every pending is well-formed, the beat
 *   signature only moves monotonically forward, and the season actually REACHES a terminal state.
 *
 * The Python half (`frontend/tests/test_sync_audit.py`) covers the other prevention: the
 * pending-decision barrier blocks the model from narrating past EVERY player decision kind.
 *
 * Roles only — no names. Seed-stable and fully deterministic (no real LLM, no real embeddings).
