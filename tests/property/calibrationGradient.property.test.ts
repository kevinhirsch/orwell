/**
 * Calibration GRADIENT gate, SHARD RUNNER (calibration-instrumentation lane, 2026-06-19; sharded
 * 2026-06-19 for CI wall-clock).
 *
 * `juryReach.property.test.ts` gates the PASSIVE extreme only. This gate measures the GRADIENT: a
 * MINIMAL-ACTIVE policy (a few recorded social scenes + basic self-preservation) must reach the jury
 * AT LEAST AS OFTEN and win AT LEAST AS OFTEN as the fully-passive policy across the same seeded
 * seasons — the monotonic property that "playing the game is never WORSE than not playing it". See
 * {@link file://./calibrationGradientShared.ts} for the policy, driver, and canonical band, and its
 * spec header for the full rationale.
 *
 * **Sharding (the ONLY structural change):** each seed plays an independent, per-seed-seeded
 * passive+active PAIR, so the play fans out across CI runners. This file is now a SHARD RUNNER: with
 * `GRADIENT_SHARDS=N` (and `GRADIENT_SHARD=k`) it plays ONLY its contiguous seed slice
 * `[shardRange(k,N))` and writes the per-seed measurements to a JSON artifact — it makes NO band
 * assertion (a slice can't see the active-vs-passive distribution). The full band is asserted by the
 * dependent AGGREGATE test (`calibrationGradientAggregate.property.test.ts`), which downloads every
 * shard artifact and recombines.
 *
 * UNSHARDED (no `GRADIENT_SHARDS`, the local `npm run test:heavy:gradient` path) it plays ALL
 * {@link SEEDS} seeds and runs the band assertion inline — so a single local run still gates the
 * full property exactly as before. The policy, SEED count, and band are IDENTICAL to the pre-shard
 * single-file gate; only WHERE the seeds are played moved. It is a HEAVY simulation (two full-season
 * sweeps per seed). Roles only — no houseguest names.
