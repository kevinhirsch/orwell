/**
 * L21/L24 — the RNG-ISOLATION regression guard (the golden test the feature lives or dies on).
 *
 * NPC-personality movement weighting (`presence.ts` / `presenceConstants.ts`) bends each NPC's
 * room-to-room movement by WHO they are (social aptitude + soul volatility). TWO prior attempts at this
 * broke the seeded `juryReach` calibration gate — both by changing how the orchestrator's SHARED per-user
 * RNG stream (which drives the off-screen society + relationship folds + downstream nomination/vote
 * decisions) is consumed during `presenceTick`:
 *   1. The FIRST reverted attempt ADDED extra weighting rolls to the shared stream — re-phasing it.
 *   2. The SECOND (the first ship of this feature) over-corrected and stopped drawing from the shared
 *      stream ENTIRELY (all movement went to a dedicated stream) — which ALSO re-phased every later
 *      shared-stream consumer, because the un-weighted room assignment used to BE part of the spine.
 *
 * THE FIX, proven here AND in `tests/unit/presence.test.ts` (the shared-draw-count guard): the
 * CALIBRATION-NEUTRAL BASE assignment — `presenceBase`, what the off-screen society pairs on — STILL
 * draws from the SHARED per-user stream, un-weighted, with the EXACT same draw count as the pre-feature
 * build, so the shared stream is advanced byte-identically and the competition/vote outcomes are
 * UNCHANGED. ONLY the personality-WEIGHTED, player-facing positions ride a DEDICATED stream that
 * `presenceTick` forks off the GAME seed + a persisted per-tick counter. So however differently the
 * weighting moves the player-facing house, the calibration spine is byte-for-byte unchanged.
 *
 * The golden assertion: drive the SAME seeded passive live season twice through the SAME runtime the
 * production composition (and `juryReach`) uses — once with the DEFAULT movement weighting, once with
 * the weighting cranked to an EXTREME (every houseguest a manic roamer / a frozen homebody) — and the
 * full sequence of PUBLIC competition/eviction/ceremony beat outcomes must match line-for-line. If the
 * movement stream were not isolated, the extreme weighting would shift the shared stream and the
 * outcomes would diverge. (The companion permanent gate is `juryReach.property.test.ts` itself.)
 *
 * Roles only — no houseguest names; outcomes are read off the public beat content, never the Vault.
