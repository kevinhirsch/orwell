/**
 * 0101/#1401 Phase-2 (#1455) — the calibration GRADIENT gate, run with the OUTCOME-AFFECTING SHOWRUNNER
 * REWEIGHT flag ON. The gradient asserts the MONOTONIC social-play band over {@link SEEDS} seeds played as
 * a passive+active pair each: active jury-reach ≥ passive AND active wins ≥ passive across the set (a
 * player who shows up does at least as well). This is the "earned-wins inversion" guard the acceptance bar
 * names — if the reweight bent the closed-set spine so that showing up stopped paying, THIS band breaks and
 * ship BLOCKS. It is surfaced here, never papered over.
 *
 * The reweight is flipped process-globally for the whole run and reset in `afterAll`. Methodology + the
 * band are IMPORTED UNCHANGED from `calibrationGradientShared` — only the flag differs from the OFF gate,
 * so any gradient divergence is a real, attributable reweight effect. Roles only — no houseguest names.
 *
 * (Measured 2026-07-12: the thread scheduler's folds move only the OPEN-SET `player→NPC` reads, which the
 * synthetic passive/active drivers do not act on, so this ON run reproduces the OFF gradient; the gate is
 * the permanent GUARD that a future reweight change can never invert the "playing the game pays" property.)
