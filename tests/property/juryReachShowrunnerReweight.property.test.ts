/**
 * 0101/#1401 Phase-2 (#1455) — the jury-reach calibration gate, run with the OUTCOME-AFFECTING SHOWRUNNER
 * REWEIGHT flag ON. The sibling living-house layers (0087 trajectories / 0092 secret pacing) prove
 * neutrality-when-OFF by byte-identity; the reweight is different — it re-orders which simmering thread
 * wins the scheduler's scarce per-tick slot, so it CANNOT be pinned outcome-neutral by construction. Its
 * acceptance bar is instead a DISTRIBUTION one: the exact same passive {@link SEEDS}-season jury-reach band
 * (`assertBand` — FLOOR/CEILING reach + the F2_WIN_MAX ceiling + the EARNED_WINS teeth) must still hold with
 * the reweight ON. A band break BLOCKS ship (it would mean the producer notes bent the closed-set fairness
 * spine) — it is surfaced here, never papered over.
 *
 * The reweight is flipped process-globally for the whole run (the same mechanism the God-Mode dial +
 * `secretPacing` use), so every season `playSeeds` composes plays under it, then reset in `afterAll` so it
 * never leaks to another file. Methodology + the band are IMPORTED UNCHANGED from `juryReachShared` — only
 * the flag differs from the OFF gate, so any divergence is a real, attributable reweight effect. Roles
 * only — no houseguest names.
 *
 * (Measured 2026-07-12: because the thread scheduler's folds move only the player's OWN `player→NPC` reads
 * — the OPEN set — and a PASSIVE driver never acts on those, this ON run reproduces the OFF band; the gate
 * is the permanent GUARD that a future change to the reweight can never bend the deterministic jury-reach
 * fairness spine. The reweight's real re-pacing lands on a live player, whom this driver cannot model.)
