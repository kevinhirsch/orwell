/**
 * Calibration GRADIENT gate — shared spine (shard runner + aggregate).
 *
 * The gate plays {@link SEEDS} seeds, each as TWO full live seasons — a fully-PASSIVE policy and a
 * MINIMAL-ACTIVE one — over the SAME seed, and asserts a MONOTONIC band over the DISTRIBUTION:
 * active jury-reach ≥ passive AND active wins ≥ passive across the set, with a sanity floor. Each
 * seed's passive+active pair is independent and per-seed seeded, so the play can be SHARDED across
 * CI runners — each shard plays a contiguous seed slice and emits its per-seed measurements; an
 * aggregate step recombines ALL shards and runs the one band assertion.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for BOTH halves: the seed-playing driver
 * ({@link playSeed}/{@link playSeeds}) and the aggregate assertion ({@link assertGradient}) over the
 * full set — so a shard and the aggregate can never drift on methodology or numbers. The policy,
 * the SEED count, and the asserted band are UNCHANGED from the pre-shard single-file gate; only
 * WHERE the seeds are played moved. Roles only — no houseguest names.
 *
 * Methodology mirrors `juryReach` exactly — seeded multi-season runs through the SAME live runtime
 * `main.ts` composes (composeRuntime → registry → orchestrator commit spine, pure turn-driven). The
 * ONLY difference between the two arms is the player policy, run over the SAME seeds, so any gap is
 * a REAL, attributable effect of social play — never noise (seeded determinism: same seeds ⇒ same
 * outcomes). The player's seat is read from the PUBLIC 0046 seam (`GameStateView.player.status`).
