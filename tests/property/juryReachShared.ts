/**
 * D4/E33 — the jury-reach calibration gate, shared spine (shard runner + aggregate).
 *
 * The gate plays {@link SEEDS} passive seeded live seasons and asserts a CALIBRATION property on
 * the DISTRIBUTION over all of them (floor/ceiling reach band, a rare-F2-win ceiling, and an
 * earned-win check). The seasons are independent and per-season seeded, so the play can be SHARDED
 * across CI runners — each shard plays a contiguous seed slice and emits its per-season
 * measurements; an aggregate step recombines ALL shards and runs the one distribution assertion.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for BOTH halves: the seed-playing driver
 * ({@link playSeed}/{@link playSeeds}) and the aggregate assertion ({@link assertBand}) over the
 * full set — so a shard and the aggregate can never drift on the methodology or the numbers.
 * The bands/seed-count are UNCHANGED from the pre-shard single-file gate; only WHERE the seeds
 * are played moved. Roles only — no houseguest names.
