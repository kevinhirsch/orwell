/**
 * D4/E33 — the jury-reach calibration gate, SHARD RUNNER (audit 2026-06-10, Theme 5; round-4 R5
 * → round-6 R11; sharded 2026-06-19 for CI wall-clock).
 *
 * Round 4 measured 62/62 passive seeded seasons ending in a pre-jury player eviction — the jury,
 * the finale, the juror's seat, and eviction night were unreachable content in practice. Round 6
 * (R11) reframed it: the ladder works; the survival rate is a CALIBRATION property that needs a
 * permanent gate. This is that gate.
 *
 * Methodology (unchanged): seeded multi-season runs through the LIVE loop — the same runtime
 * composition `main.ts` uses (composeRuntime → registry → orchestrator commit spine, pure
 * turn-driven, one bounded off-screen tick per beat) — driven by a PASSIVE player policy (no
 * social game, every engine pending answered minimally). The player's outcome is read from the
 * PUBLIC 0046 seam (`GameStateView.player.status`). See {@link file://./juryReachShared.ts} for
 * the driver + the canonical band, and the spec headers there for the FLOOR/CEILING rationale.
 *
 * **Sharding (the ONLY structural change):** the 20 seasons are independent and per-season seeded,
 * so the play fans out across CI runners. This file is now a SHARD RUNNER: with `JURY_SHARDS=N`
 * (and `JURY_SHARD=k`) it plays ONLY its contiguous seed slice `[shardRange(k,N))` and writes the
 * per-season measurements to a JSON artifact — it makes NO band assertion (a slice can't see the
 * distribution). The full-20 band is asserted by the dependent AGGREGATE test
 * (`juryReachAggregate.property.test.ts`), which downloads every shard artifact and recombines.
 *
 * UNSHARDED (no `JURY_SHARDS`, the local `npm run test:heavy:jury` path) it plays ALL 20 seeds and
 * runs the band assertion inline — so a single local run still gates the full property exactly as
 * before. Bands and seed count are IDENTICAL to the pre-shard single-file gate; only WHERE the
 * seeds are played moved. The gate rides seeded determinism (same seeds ⇒ same outcomes), so a
 * failure is always a REAL behavior change in the nomination/vote/relationship calibration, never
 * noise. Roles only — no houseguest names.
