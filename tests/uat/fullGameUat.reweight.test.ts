/**
 * 0101/#1401 Phase-2 (#1455) — the full-game UAT, run with the OUTCOME-AFFECTING SHOWRUNNER REWEIGHT flag
 * ON. The 12-seed / 5-seed UAT files assert the loop's structural invariants (every game FINISHES, no
 * Vault-stat leak in any player response, no illegal-id / ceremony / roster anomaly, ≥1 week played). The
 * reweight re-orders which simmering thread the off-screen tick surfaces — which perturbs the hidden layer
 * — so this file re-runs a modest seed slice WITH it on and proves the loop STILL completes cleanly under
 * it: the pacing bias must never wedge a game, leak the Vault, or break a ceremony.
 *
 * The reweight is flipped process-globally BEFORE the harness composes its runtime (so every session it
 * builds plays under it) and reset in `afterAll`. Roles only — no houseguest names.
