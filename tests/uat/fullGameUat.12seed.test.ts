/**
 * tests/uat/fullGameUat.12seed.test.ts
 *
 * Heavy-sims lane: uat-12seed.
 *
 * The primary completion run — 12 seeds, never-use-veto, played to a winner via the
 * direct callTool path (no HTTP: the transport layer added non-deterministic overhead
 * that caused stale-loop failures in CI for some seeds). One of the three slices the
 * former single fullGameUat.test.ts was split into so its independent `it` blocks fan
 * out across separate CI runners; seeds and assertions are unchanged.
 *
 * **Seed-sharding (structural only):** this block asserts PER-SEED properties only (each game
 * finishes, no anomalies, ≥1 week played, and — over a non-empty slice — total player decisions
 * > 0); it runs NO cross-seed aggregate. So with `UAT12_SHARDS=N` (`UAT12_SHARD=k`) it plays ONLY
 * its contiguous seed slice and asserts INDEPENDENTLY over it — the union of the shards is the
 * full 12 seeds, each played exactly once, no assertion weakened. Unset (the local
 * `npm run test:heavy:uat-12seed` path) plays all 12. See {@link resolveUatSeedShard}.
 *
 * See tests/uat/fullGameUatHarness.ts for the shared driver + invariant checkers.
