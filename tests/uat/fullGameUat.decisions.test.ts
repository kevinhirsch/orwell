/**
 * tests/uat/fullGameUat.decisions.test.ts
 *
 * Heavy-sims lane: uat-decisions.
 *
 * Decision-type coverage — proves all of the player's recurring decision types are
 * exercised across the seed set, driven over the REAL HTTP transport (the deployed
 * path). One of the three slices the former single fullGameUat.test.ts was split into
 * so its independent `it` blocks fan out across separate CI runners; seeds and
 * assertions are unchanged. The co-located health-endpoint sanity check also rides
 * the live HTTP server this file already stands up.
 *
 * The decision-coverage assertion re-derives over seeds 1-5 (a representative subset
 * of the 12-seed set, run independently here over HTTP rather than re-using the
 * 12-seed run's data) — EXACTLY as before. It asserts the same player decision types
 * (nominations + eviction-vote) appear; the assertion is not weakened by the split.
 *
 * See tests/uat/fullGameUatHarness.ts for the shared driver + invariant checkers.
