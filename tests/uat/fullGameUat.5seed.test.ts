/**

 *
 * Heavy-sims lane: uat-5seed.
 *
 * The veto-use path — 5 seeds, always-use-veto, via the direct callTool path. Exercises
 * veto-save, the replacement decision, and the final-4 veto-revert (no legal replacement →
 * the engine reverts; the replacement pend is absent). One of the three slices the former
 * single fullGameUat.test.ts was split into so its independent `it` blocks fan out across
 * separate CI runners; seeds and assertions are unchanged.
 *
 * See tests/uat/fullGameUatHarness.ts for the shared driver + invariant checkers.
