# WWDC25 Session 310: Build an AppKit app with the new design
URL: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/310/
Presenter: Jeff Nadeau (frameworks engineering manager, Apple)

**Retrieval note:** Fetched 2026-06-24 via WebFetch against the developer.apple.com video page,
which carries the full on-page **Transcript** tab. The page and transcript were reachable and
**complete end to end**; this catalog reproduces the **entire transcript verbatim**, every
chapter, and **every on-screen code sample** in fenced Swift (AppKit) blocks with its timestamp.
Apple did **not** expose a separate "Code" download tab for this session — the code blocks below
are the on-screen samples transcribed verbatim. Quotes are exact; `[bracketed]` notes are mine.

This is an **AppKit** session (`NS*` APIs). The conceptual SwiftUI equivalents are noted in the
extraction summary (e.g. `.glassEffect`, `GlassEffectContainer`, `.buttonStyle(.glass)`,
`.buttonBorderShape`, `.controlSize(.extraLarge)`). Companion design talk = **session 356**
("Get to know the new design system", cataloged as `lg_wwdc_356_transcript.md`); foundations =
**session 219** ("Meet Liquid Glass", `lg_wwdc_219_transcript.md`).

# ACTIONABLE EXTRACTION (per element class) — apply to the element kit

> Concise, load-bearing rules first. **Full verbatim transcript follows below.** Apple states
> **few hard pixel numbers** in this session — the concrete levers are *shape-by-size*, the
> five-size hierarchy, tint **prominence**, concentricity math, and glass **grouping**. Every
> numeric value Apple actually states is collected in "Concrete values" at the end of this block.

### Buttons (`.ow-btn`)
- **Shape follows size:** **mini / small / medium → rounded rectangle** (horizontal density);
  **large / extra-large → capsule**. Capsule radius = ½ container height (356).
- **Five sizes = hierarchy:** mini → small → medium → large → **extra-large** (new in Tahoe).
  Extra-large is reserved for the **single most prominent action** ("the actions that people
  launch your app to get done"). Don't make everything large.
- **Never hard-code height.** mini/small/medium are now *slightly taller* (more label breathing
  room + bigger click/tap target). Size via padding + line-height, adapt with layout.
- **Glass bezel = floating buttons only:** the glass material "replaces the standard button
  backing… perfect for buttons that need to float atop other content." Reserve glass for the
  top control/nav layer; keep in-content buttons in the content layer (no glass-on-glass — 219).
- **Tint, don't fill:** tint the glass (accent, or a specific color) rather than an opaque solid
  fill (a solid fill "breaks the visual character of Liquid Glass" — 219).
- **Tint *prominence* (4 levels)** controls visual weight of the tint: `automatic` · `none` ·
  `secondary` (subdued; defaults to accent) · `primary` (most prominent). Use `secondary` for
  colored-but-supporting buttons so they don't upstage the default/primary action.
- **One primary per context:** the **default button** auto-takes `primary` prominence (AppKit: the
  one wired to Return / `keyEquivalent = "\r"`). Everything else `secondary`/`none`.
- **Destructive = red at `secondary` prominence** — red signals danger without overpowering
  neighbors.
- **Concentric nesting / shape override:** to make a button concentric inside a container, override
  its shape (AppKit `borderShape`; SwiftUI `.buttonBorderShape`). Works for buttons, **pop-up
  buttons, and segmented controls**. 356: inner radius = parent radius − padding; use a concentric
  shape **with a fallback radius** for a control that must work both nested and standalone.
- AppKit APIs: `NSButton.bezelStyle` (glass), `bezelColor`, `borderShape`, `tintProminence`,
  `keyEquivalent`.

### Toolbar items (relevant to button bars / our chrome)
- AppKit auto-groups multiple toolbar **buttons** onto one glass; different control *types*
  (segmented, pop-up, search) get their **own** glass. Override grouping with
  `NSToolbarItemGroup` or spacers.
- **Prominent style:** `toolbarItem.style = .prominent` → tints glass with the **accent color**
  (for state / important action). Specific color via `toolbarItem.backgroundTintColor`.
- **Remove glass from non-interactive items** (titles, status text): `toolbarItem.isBordered =
  false` — otherwise informational text "almost looks like a button."
- **Badging:** `NSItemBadge.count(4)` / `.text("New")` / `.indicator` for new/pending content.
- Glass is **adaptive** — switches light/dark with scrolled content brightness via `NSAppearance`
  (your Dark Mode work carries over).

### Sliders
- **Track-fill via tint prominence:** `none` ⇒ track NOT filled; `secondary`/`primary` ⇒ filled
  with accent color.
- **`neutralValue`** (new, Tahoe): anchors the fill at **any** point on the track, not just the
  minimum end (e.g. playback-speed control anchored at **1x** — fill grows either way from default).

### Segmented controls & pop-up buttons
- Same `borderShape` override applies (capsule, to sit concentrically in a capsule container).
- Get their own glass in toolbars (separate from button groups).

### Menus (menu bar + context)
- Big icon expansion: both menu-bar and context menus now use **icons for key actions**; within a
  section the icons form **a single scannable column**. Add recognizable SF Symbols to key items.
  (Symbol-choice guidance lives in session 356.)

### Custom content on glass (panels / floating UI)
- `NSGlassEffectView` — set `.contentView` (do **not** place the glass behind content as a sibling;
  it must wrap the content so AppKit applies legibility treatments). Customize via `.cornerRadius`
  and tint color. Geometry auto-ties to contentView via Auto Layout.
- **Group adjacent glass in `NSGlassEffectContainerView`** (SwiftUI: `GlassEffectContainer`): (a)
  elements fluidly meld/separate by proximity + the `spacing` property; (b) shared adaptive
  appearance; (c) **correctness** — "glass can't directly sample other glass," so a shared sampling
  region is needed; also **one sampling pass = faster**. *(Direct rationale for our CSS/SVG
  refraction work: share ONE backdrop sample region per group rather than per-element filters.)*
- **Capsule glass** in code = `cornerRadius = 999`.

### Window / structure (context for our window kit `.ow-*`)
- **Concentricity** everywhere: glass elements curve to nest inside the **window** corner radius.
  Windows now have **softer, more generous** radii; **windows with toolbars use a larger radius**
  (wraps the glass toolbar, scales with toolbar size); **titlebar-only windows keep a smaller
  radius** (wraps window controls).
- **Corner collision avoidance:** `NSView.LayoutRegion` — `layoutGuide(for: .safeArea(cornerAdaptation:
  .horizontal | .vertical))` insets a region by the corner size so content nested near a corner
  isn't clipped.
- **Sidebars** = floating glass pane above content; **inspectors** = edge-to-edge glass alongside.
  Use `NSSplitViewController`. Remove old `NSVisualEffectView` sidebar materials (they block the
  glass). Let content flow under the sidebar: `splitViewItem.automaticallyAdjustsSafeAreaInsets =
  true` (set on the *content*, not the sidebar). Mirror/blur content edge-to-edge with
  `NSBackgroundExtensionView`.

### Scroll edge effect (legibility where glass overlaps scrolling content)
- Two styles: **soft** (progressive fade+blur — default, most cases) and **hard** (more opaque
  backing, stronger separation — pinned headers / accessory views; mostly macOS).
- Lives in `NSScrollView`; auto-applied under toolbar items, titlebar accessories, and the new
  **split item accessories**. **Not decorative** (356) — only where floating UI overlaps content;
  one per view; don't mix/stack soft+hard.

### Inherited accessibility (free with the material — 219)
- Reduced Transparency (frostier), Increased Contrast (predominantly black/white + contrasting
  border), Reduced Motion (disables elastic effects). A glass `.ow-btn`/panel should honor the same
  media queries.

### Concrete values Apple states in THIS session
- New **5th control size: extra-large** (macOS Tahoe).
- **`cornerRadius = 999`** = capsule glass element.
- **`keyEquivalent = "\r"`** = default button ⇒ auto `primary` tint prominence.
- `tintProminence` cases: **automatic / none / secondary / primary**.
- Slider `neutralValue` example anchor = **1x** (playback speed).
- Badge example: **count(4)**, text **"New"**.
- Toolbar specific-color example: **`.systemGreen`**.
- **No pixel heights / paddings / radii** are given numerically — Apple defers to Auto Layout +
  size tokens. The numeric shape math (capsule = ½ height; concentric inner = parent − padding; the
  three shape types fixed/capsule/concentric) is in session **356**.

# FULL VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT

## 0:00 — Introduction

> Hi, I'm Jeff Nadeau, a frameworks engineering manager at Apple, and you're watching "Build an
> AppKit app with the new design".
>
> The new design of macOS establishes a common foundation for the look and feel of Mac apps, with
> refreshed materials and controls throughout the system.
>
> A key element of this new design is the Liquid Glass material, a translucent surface that
> reflects and refracts light, creating a sense of depth and dynamism within the user interface.
> AppKit has everything you need to adapt to this new design. I'll take you through the important
> changes to the framework, outlining the behaviors that you can expect on macOS Tahoe and the new
> APIs that you can use to fine-tune your adoption of the new design.
>
> I'll go through these changes from the top down, starting with the basic structural components of
> your application. Then, I'll introduce the scroll edge effect, a visual effect that provides
> legibility atop edge-to-edge scrolling content.
>
> The new design also includes a big update to the appearance and layout of controls.
>
> Finally, I'll dig into the Liquid Glass material, how it works and the AppKit APIs that you can
> use to adopt glass in your custom UI elements.
>
> I'll get started with app structure.

## 1:23 — App structure

> The new design system transforms the appearance of a Mac window, altering the window shape and
> framing its key structural regions in glass.
>
> One of those regions is the toolbar. In the new design system, toolbar elements are placed on a
> glass material, and the entire toolbar appears to float above the content, enhancing the sense of
> hierarchy within the window.
>
> The glass also brings controls together in logical groups. Since they all represent singular
> actions, AppKit automatically groups multiple toolbar buttons together on one piece of glass.
> Different types of controls are separated out into their own glass elements, like segmented
> controls, pop-up buttons and the search control. AppKit determines this grouping automatically
> based on the type of each item's control view.
>
> To override the automatic behavior, use NSToolbarItemGroup to group items together or insert
> spacers to separate items. The Liquid Glass material is adaptive, which means that it reacts
> intelligently to its context, changing its appearance to suit the brightness of the content
> behind it. The toolbar glass will even switch between a light and dark appearance if the scrolled
> content is especially bright or dark.
>
> This appearance change is communicated to the toolbar's content using the NSAppearance system so
> any work that you've done to support Dark Mode applies here as well. NSToolbar automatically puts
> the glass material behind every toolbar item but not every item should appear over glass.
> Non-interactive items like custom titles and status indicators should avoid the glass material.
>
> The informational text in the Photos toolbar is a great example. With the glass material backing,
> it almost looks like a button. You can remove the glass from an NSToolbarItem by setting the
> isBordered property to false.

```swift
// Removing toolbar item glass
toolbarItem.isBordered = false
```

> Now that's looking much better.
>
> For the rest of your toolbar items, the glass material has one other neat feature - tinting. Use
> the new style property on NSToolbarItem to specify a prominent style. The prominent style tints
> the glass using the accent color, which is perfect for displaying state or emphasizing an
> important action.
>
> To further customize the appearance of a prominent toolbar item, use the backgroundTintColor
> property to choose a specific color for the glass. There's one other way to call attention to a
> toolbar item - badging.

```swift
// Tints the glass with the accent color.
toolbarItem.style = .prominent

// Tints the glass with a specific color.
toolbarItem.backgroundTintColor = .systemGreen
```

> Use the NSItemBadge API to indicate that a toolbar item navigates to new or pending content. For
> example, you can use a badge to indicate a number of unread messages or the presence of new
> notifications.

```swift
// Numeric badge
NSItemBadge.count(4)

// Text badge
NSItemBadge.text("New")

// Badge indicator
NSItemBadge.indicator
```

> With glass toolbars handled, I'll move on to the main content of the window, which is often
> organized using a split view. In the new design, sidebars appear as a pane of glass that floats
> above the window's content, whereas inspectors use an edge-to-edge glass that sits alongside the
> content. To get this effect in your application, use NSSplitViewController. When you create split
> items with a sidebar or inspector behaviors, AppKit presents them with the appropriate glass
> material automatically.
>
> Now that the sidebar sits atop glass, the legacy sidebar material is no longer necessary. If
> you're using an NSVisualEffectView to display that material inside of your sidebar, it will
> prevent the glass material from showing through. You should remove these visual effect views from
> your view hierarchy.
>
> Since the sidebar glass appears to float above the window, it can appear over content from the
> adjacent split. This works great if you have horizontal scrolling content, list items which slide
> over to reveal swipe actions or rich content like a map or a movie poster that can extend into the
> sidebar region.
>
> To allow your split content to appear underneath the sidebar, set the
> automaticallyAdjustsSafeAreaInsets property to true. Be sure to set this on the content that you
> want to extend under the sidebar and not on the sidebar itself. When this property is true,
> NSSplitView will extend that item's frame beneath the sidebar and then apply a safe area layout
> guide to help you position your content within the unobscured area.

```swift
// Content under the sidebar
splitViewItem.automaticallyAdjustsSafeAreaInsets = true
```

> Rich content, like photographs or artwork, really showcase the floating glass material in the
> sidebar but it's often undesirable to cover up some portion of the content to get that effect.
> This App Store poster creates a striking effect when displayed edge-to-edge but the artwork
> doesn't include any extra negative space to accommodate the size of the sidebar. Hiding the
> sidebar reveals what's really happening here. The content is being mirrored and blurred, extending
> the appearance of the artwork without actually obscuring any of its content. AppKit has a new API
> that provides this effect.
>
> It's called NSBackgroundExtensionView. This view uses the safe area to position your content in
> the unobscured portion of the view, while extending its appearance edge-to-edge using a visual
> effect.
>
> To put this into practice, create a NSBackgroundExtensionView and position it to fill the entire
> frame of the split item. Assign it a content view, which it positions in the safe area, avoiding
> the floating sidebar. And that's it. The background extension view will automatically create a
> replica of the content view to fill the space outside of the safe area. The floating sidebar,
> along with the toolbar, demonstrate a key element of the new design system: concentricity. Each
> element is designed with a curvature that sits neatly within the corner radius of its container,
> in this case the window itself. And this relationship goes both ways. In the new design system,
> windows now have a softer, more generous corner radius, which varies based on the style of window.
> Windows with toolbars now use a larger radius, which is designed to wrap concentrically around the
> glass toolbar elements, scaling to match the size of the toolbar. Titlebar-only windows retain a
> smaller corner radius, wrapping compactly around the window controls. These larger corners provide
> a softer feel and elegant concentricity to the window but they can also clip content that sits
> close to the edge of the window. To position content that nests into a corner, use the new
> NSView.LayoutRegion API. A layout region describes an area of a view, like the safe area, but with
> features like corner avoidance built in. You can inset a region either horizontally or vertically
> by the size of the corner. I'll take you through the API.
>
> You can obtain a region for either the safe area or the area with standard layout margins.
>
> The region includes corner adaptation, which can apply either a horizontal or vertical inset to
> the region. From a layout region, use the layoutGuide method to obtain a guide for applying auto
> layout constraints.
>
> You can also obtain the raw geometry of the region in the form of edge insets or its current
> rectangle.
>
> Here's an example of the new API in action. My new folder button is colliding with this corner,
> and I want to constrain it to a region that avoids this collision.
>
> So, in an updateConstraints method, I obtain a layout guide for the safe area, including
> horizontal corner adaptation. This layout guide is just like the typical safe area layout guide
> but it includes an extra inset on the edge with the corner.
>
> Then, I create a few layout constraints to tie the button's geometry to the safe area guide.

```swift
// Avoiding a window corner

func updateConstraints() {
    guard !installedButtonConstraints else { return }

    let safeArea = layoutGuide(for: .safeArea(cornerAdaptation: .horizontal))

    NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
        safeArea.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: button.leadingAnchor),
        safeArea.trailingAnchor.constraint(greaterThanOrEqualTo: button.trailingAnchor),
        safeArea.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: button.bottomAnchor)
    ])
    installedButtonConstraints = true
}
```

> It only took a few lines of code, and now my button sits nicely alongside the corner. Next, I'll
> introduce the scroll edge effect.

## 9:27 — Scroll edge effect

> The new design encourages flowing your content edge-to-edge, with Liquid Glass elements floating
> atop. To provide separation between the glass and the content, the system applies a visual effect
> in the areas where these two overlap. This effect comes in two variants: a soft-edge-style, which
> progressively fades and blurs the content, and a hard-edge-style, which uses a more opaque backing
> to provide greater separation between the content and the floating elements.
>
> For scrollable content, the scroll edge effect lives inside NSScrollView. The scroll view varies
> the size and shape of the effect based on the content floating above it. The effect adapts
> automatically as floating elements come and go. The scroll edge effect is applied automatically
> underneath toolbar items, titlebar accessories, and a new type of accessory, split item
> accessories. Split item accessories are very similar to titlebar accessories, except they only
> span one split within a split view controller, and they can be placed at either the top or bottom
> edge of the split. To add a split item accessory, create a NSSplitViewItemAccessoryViewController,
> and attach it to the split view item using the addTopAligned- or
> addBottomAlignedAccessoryViewController method.
>
> Split item accessories, along with titlebar accessories, are the best way to incorporate floating
> content into the scroll edge effect. They influence the size and shape of the effect, and they
> inset the content safe area, simplifying content layout.

## 11:10 — Controls

> Now, no design system is complete without my personal favorite - controls. Controls have an all
> new look in macOS Tahoe. The new design creates a stronger family resemblance across devices,
> unifying the appearance of elements like buttons, switches and sliders between macOS, iOS and
> iPadOS. These changes have been thoughtfully applied to retain the character and capability that
> you expect from Mac controls.
>
> macOS controls are available in a variety of standard sizes, ranging from mini all the way up to
> large. These sizes establish varying levels of density and hierarchy among your controls. macOS
> Tahoe adds one more size to this list - extra large - for emphasizing your most important actions.
>
> The extra large size is ideal for showcasing the most prominent actions in your application. These
> are the actions that people launch your app to get done, like queuing up some music in a media
> player or placing a call in a communications app. In addition to the new size, we've also taken
> the opportunity to rethink the heights of controls.
>
> Compared to previous releases of macOS, the mini, small, and medium controls are now slightly
> taller, providing a little more breathing room around the control label and enhancing the size of
> the click target. To adapt to varying control heights, use Auto Layout and avoid hard-coding the
> heights of controls. For compatibility with existing high-density layouts, like complex inspectors
> and popovers, AppKit provides an API to request control sizes that match previous releases of
> macOS.
>
> Use the new prefersCompactControlSizeMetrics property on NSView. This property is inherited down
> the view hierarchy, and when it's set to true, AppKit controls will revert to sizing that is
> compatible with previous releases of macOS.
>
> The new design system introduces some new control shapes as well. The mini through medium sizes
> retain a rounded-rectangle shape, which enables greater horizontal density, while the large and
> extra-large sizes round out into a capsule shape, making use of all that extra space. To achieve
> concentricity in your custom designs, you can override the preferred shape of a control.
>
> In this example, I've built a custom call-out bar for spell-checking using medium-sized controls.
> The container for the bar has a capsule shape but it doesn't fit well with the rounded rectangle
> controls inside.
>
> This is a perfect use case for the new borderShape property. This API allows you to override the
> shapes of buttons, pop-up buttons and segmented controls.
>
> By overriding these controls to use a capsule shape, they fit nicely within my custom container.
>
> In addition to the shape, you can also customize the material of a button using the new glass
> bezel style.
>
> This bezel style replaces the standard button backing with the Liquid Glass material, which is
> perfect for buttons that need to float atop other content. The glass bezel style is compatible
> with the existing bezelColor property, which tints the glass using the provided color.
>
> The new design system also introduces the idea of control prominence to AppKit. By varying the
> prominence of a button, you can control the level of visual weight given to its tint color. This
> allows you to add color to a button without upstaging higher-prominence controls inside the same
> interface, such as the default button. This technique is used for destructive buttons. The
> distinctive red color is a helpful hint that the action is destructive but with a level of
> prominence that doesn't overpower nearby controls.
>
> The tint prominence type has four cases: automatic, which indicates that the control should choose
> a level of prominence appropriate for its style and configuration; none, which indicates minimal
> or no tint color; secondary, which indicates a more subdued application of the tint color; and
> primary, which applies the tint at the most prominent level.
>
> To apply a lower prominence tint to a button, set the tintProminence property to secondary. By
> default, this will display using the accent color.

```swift
// Create buttons with varying levels of prominence   (15:31)

// Prefer a "secondary" tinted appearance for the shuffle and enqueue buttons
shuffleButton.tintProminence = .secondary
playNextButton.tintProminence = .secondary

// The "play" will automatically use primary prominence because it is the default button
playButton.keyEquivalent = "\r"
```

> In this example, I'm treating the Play button a little differently because I want it to behave as
> the default button, so I've given it the return key equivalent. This ensures that the button
> responds to the keyboard in a predictable way, and since it's the default button, it'll
> automatically apply the most prominent level of tint.
>
> Tint prominence also has a function with sliders.
>
> The tintProminence API allows you to choose whether the track is filled with the accent color. A
> slider set to none will avoid filling its track, whereas a slider set to secondary or primary will
> fill it.
>
> The slider fill has learned one more trick in macOS Tahoe. It can anchor itself at any location
> along the track, rather than just the minimum end. Use the new neutralValue property to set a value
> that serves as the anchor for the track fill.
>
> In this example of a playback speed control, I've set the neutralValue to 1x, so that when the
> speed is made slower or faster, the blue fill helps communicate the difference between the selected
> value and the default value. The new design system also brings an update to menus with a refreshed
> appearance and a significant expansion in the use of icons.
>
> Both menu bar menus and context menus now use icons to represent their key actions.
>
> Within each section of a menu, the icons form a single column that's easy to scan through. Adding
> clear, recognizable symbols to your menu items helps people quickly find the most important actions
> in the menu.
>
> The "Get to know the new design system" video provides a ton of additional guidance for choosing
> symbols for your menu items. Be sure to check it out.

## 17:30 — Glass

> Finally, integrating Liquid Glass elements into your app.
>
> Before you integrate the Liquid Glass material into your custom UI elements, it's important to
> think about the design intent behind this new material.
>
> Liquid Glass elements float at the top level of the UI, elevating the controls and navigation into
> a distinct functional layer.
>
> With that in mind, limit your use of Liquid Glass to the most important elements in your app, the
> controls that belong in this top level of hierarchy. Freeform's inline editing controls are a
> great example. They float above the content rather than sitting alongside, and they work
> beautifully with the Liquid Glass material.
>
> To place your content on glass, use the NSGlassEffectView API. Setting a contentView allows AppKit
> to apply all of the necessary visual treatments to keep your content legible as the glass adapts to
> its surroundings.
>
> So avoid placing the NSGlassEffectView behind your content as a sibling view.
>
> You can customize the appearance of the glass using the corner radius and tint color properties.
> I'll take you through an example of adopting NSGlassEffectView for an existing element.
>
> In this example, I have a fitness app which shows daily training stats and a custom control for
> picking the type of workout. I'm displaying them using a horizontal NSStackView. Now, this is a
> prominent part of my UI, so I'm going to put both parts of it on glass.
>
> Adopting the Liquid Glass material takes just a few new lines of code.
>
> First, create an NSGlassEffectView for each glass element that you want to display and set each
> one's contentView property to the desired view. The glass effect view ties its geometry to the
> contentView using Auto Layout, so you don't have to worry about keeping them in sync.

```swift
// Adopting NSGlassEffectView   (18:42)

let userInfoView = UserInfoView()
let activityPickerView = ActivityPickerView()

let userInfoGlass = NSGlassEffectView()
userInfoGlass.contentView = userInfoView

let activityPickerGlass = NSGlassEffectView()
activityPickerGlass.contentView = activityPickerView

let stack = NSStackView(views: [userInfoGlass,
                                activityPickerGlass])
stack.orientation = .horizontal
```

> Then, put the glass effect views into the view hierarchy. In this example, I updated the stack
> view to swap in the new glass effect views.
>
> If you have multiple glass shapes in close proximity, group them together using
> NSGlassEffectContainerView. The glass effect container view combines multiple glass elements
> together into a single rendering effect. This has a few benefits.
>
> First, grouped glass elements can fluidly join and separate using a liquid visual effect. The
> glass shapes meld together based on their proximity and the value of the spacing property, which is
> available on NSGlassEffectContainerView.
>
> Second, the adaptive appearance of the glass is shared across the grouped elements, which ensures
> that they maintain a uniform appearance as the underlying content changes.
>
> And grouping is important for visual correctness. The Liquid Glass material reflects and refracts
> light, picking color from nearby content.
>
> To create this effect, the glass material samples content from an area larger than itself. But
> what happens if that sampling region includes another glass element? Well, glass can't directly
> sample other glass, so the visual results in this case will not be consistent.
>
> Using a glass effect container allows these elements to share their sampling region. Not only does
> this provide a more consistent visual result but it also improves the performance of the glass
> effect, since it only needs one sampling pass for the entire group.
>
> Revisiting the sample from earlier, these two glass effects are part of a logical group, so they
> need to be inside a glass effect container. It's straightforward to set one up. In this example, I
> create an NSGlassEffectContainerView and set the stack view as its content view. The container and
> its content view are also constrained together using Auto Layout, So I can cleanly swap this
> container into my existing layout. The Liquid Glass material is a powerful tool for elevating your
> app's key controls and enabling your content to flow seamlessly from edge to edge. It's a great way
> to highlight the functionality that makes your app unique.

```swift
// Adopting NSGlassEffectContainerView   (21:03)

let userInfoView = UserInfoView()
let activityPickerView = ActivityPickerView()

let userInfoGlass = NSGlassEffectView()
userInfoGlass.contentView = userInfoView
userInfoGlass.cornerRadius = 999

let activityPickerGlass = NSGlassEffectView()
activityPickerGlass.contentView = activityPickerView
activityPickerGlass.cornerRadius = 999

let stack = NSStackView(views: [userInfoGlass,
                                activityPickerGlass])
stack.orientation = .horizontal

let glassContainer = NSGlassEffectContainerView()
glassContainer.contentView = stack
```

## 21:30 — Next steps

> So what's next? As a first step, build your app with Xcode 26. A lot of the new design will start
> working right away. Extend your content edge-to-edge wherever possible, taking full advantage of
> the floating glass toolbar and sidebar.
>
> Then, adapt to the new control sizes by auditing your app for hard-coded control heights or
> inflexible layout constraints. Enhance your menu actions with symbol icons and identify key
> elements of your interface to elevate with the Liquid Glass material.
>
> Thanks for watching and thanks for making great Mac apps.
