# Orwell LLM Roleplay Playtest & Front-End Audit — Reusable Harness & Playbook

**Status:** living playbook · first authored 2026-06-18 · folds in a full multi-hour audit session.
**Audience:** a fresh agent (or human) re-running this audit from zero, with **egregious** procedural detail.
**One-line goal:** stand up the *real* stack, configure a *real* LLM, then **play the game as a consistent
persona through the actual front-end**, taking notes to debug, fixing in a batch, and re-running — iteratively.

> **You will be supplied an API key at the start.** Treat it as a session secret: store it ONLY in the
> git-ignored sandbox, configure it through the **Settings menu** (not env/source), never commit/screenshot/log
> it, and remind the operator to revoke it when done.

## 0. What this audit is (and what the template prompt got wrong)

The canonical audit brief (the "Postdoctoral HCI / Principal Front-End / Autonomous QA" prompt) is written for a
**different product** — a white-labeled job-application "workspace/applicant" portal with a `workspace/` front-door,
a Postgres+Alembic engine, `/api/applicant/*`, résumé/digest onboarding, and an `FR-`/`NFR-` denylist. **None of
that exists here.** This repo is **Orwell**, an immersive single-player *Big Brother* simulation:

- **Engine** = the TypeScript hexagonal core (`/src`), served over an HTTP MCP API (`npm start`, port **8765**).
  It owns game rules, outcomes, the Vault, and is the **single source of truth**.
- **Front-door** = the Python/FastAPI app in **`frontend/`** (a vendored AI-workspace PWA). The Big Brother game
  is **folded into the main chat**; the LLM narrates as game-master/NPCs by calling the engine's Vault-free tools.

So: keep the brief's **rigor and lenses** (spatial/Gestalt/cognitive-load, copy proofreading, autonomous visual
telemetry, the standup→capture→analyze→remediate→validate loop) but **retarget everything at `frontend/` + the TS
engine**. Ignore the `workspace/applicant`/Postgres/`FR-` specifics — they don't apply.

**Two audit dimensions, equally important:**
1. **Visual/UX/copy** — the front-end at Desktop **1440×900** and Mobile **375×812**, plus a copy/proofreading pass.
2. **LLM↔engine integration** — does the model **respect the engine** (the authority for every outcome) and stay
   in character? This is tested by **genuine persona roleplay**, not mechanical button-mashing (see §4, and the
   findings in §9 — this is where the deepest bugs live).

---

## 1. Prerequisites & network

- **API key**, supplied by the operator at the start (OpenRouter, OpenAI-compatible). Default model for this work:
  **`deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`** (a stronger model than `-flash`; see §9 B6 for why the model matters).
- Outbound egress to: `registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org`, the Playwright CDN, and the provider (`openrouter.ai`).
  Probe first: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" --max-time 4 <url>`.
- Node 22, Python 3.11 venv, both already present in this repo's toolchain.

---

## 2. Phase 1 — stand up the stack (exact commands + the gotchas that bit us)

### 2a. The engine (TypeScript, port 8765)

```bash
cd /home/user/orwell
npm install --ignore-scripts        # GOTCHA: plain `npm install` fails — fastembed→onnxruntime-node's
                                    # postinstall tries to fetch libonnxruntime.so and dies (ENOENT).
                                    # We don't need it: embeddings fall back to a deterministic fake, and
                                    # esbuild's platform binary still installs. --ignore-scripts is the fix.
npm run build                       # bundles dist/main.js (+ dist/embedWorker.js)
ORWELL_ENGINE_PORT=8765 ORWELL_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.audit-telemetry/engine-data" node dist/main.js
```

- Run the engine with the harness's **`run_in_background: true`**, NOT a bare `&`. **GOTCHA (cost us 20 min):**
  a `&`-backgrounded process is a child of that Bash call's shell; when the tool call returns, the shell exits and
  the child is **reaped** (SIGHUP). The engine appears to die "randomly." `run_in_background` tracks it across calls.
- Health: `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8765/health` → `{"ok":true,...,"embeddings":{"provider":"deterministic"}}`.
- Embeddings unset ⇒ deterministic fake (fine for the audit). The engine's tool transport is
  `POST /player/call` with `{"name":<tool>,"args":{...}}` and header `X-Orwell-User: <user>`.

### 2b. The front-door (Python/FastAPI, port 7000)

```bash
cd /home/user/orwell/frontend
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt   # first time only
# create a DETERMINISTIC admin account (auth on = realistic posture + unlocks admin-only settings):
ORWELL_ADMIN_USER=admin ORWELL_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<pick-one>' ORWELL_SKIP_ADMIN_PROMPT=1 \
  ORWELL_SKIP_RUN_HINT=1 ORWELL_DATA_DIR="$PWD/data" python setup.py
# run it (auth ON, loopback bypass OFF, the reduced game build, pointed at the engine):
ORWELL_GAME_BUILD=1 AUTH_ENABLED=true LOCALHOST_BYPASS=false \
  ORWELL_ENGINE_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765 ORWELL_DATA_DIR="$PWD/data" \
  python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7000
```

- Store the admin password in the git-ignored sandbox (`.audit-telemetry/.secrets.env`).
- Verify: `/login` → 200; `/` → 302 (redirect to login when unauthed); `POST /api/auth/login` with the creds → 200.
- Handshake: `GET /api/orwell/health` → `{"engine":true,...}`.
- **`frontend/data/` is git-ignored** (it holds the SQLite DB with the admin account + the model endpoint +
  **the API key**). The `.audit-telemetry/` sandbox is git-ignored too. The key never reaches a commit.

### 2c. Configure the model THROUGH the Settings menu (admin)

The Settings → AI "add endpoint" form posts to `POST /api/model-endpoints`; the default-model save posts to
`POST /api/auth/settings` (admin-only). Drive those (same store, same effect as clicking the menu):

```bash
# 1) register the provider endpoint (require_admin honored with auth on via the admin cookie):
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/model-endpoints -b cookies.txt \
  -F "name=OpenRouter" -F "base_url=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" -F "api_key=$OR_KEY" \
  -F "endpoint_kind=api" -F "model_type=llm" -F "require_models=true"     # returns {id: <endpoint_id>, models:[...]}
# 2) set the default chat model (admin-only):
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:7000/api/auth/settings -b cookies.txt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"default_endpoint_id":"<endpoint_id>","default_model":"deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro","default_model_fallbacks":[]}'
# confirm: GET /api/default-chat → {"model":"deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro", ...}
```

- **GOTCHA:** `POST /api/auth/settings` is **admin-only** and the loopback-bypass user is NOT admin — that's why we
  run real auth + a real admin account (§2b), not `LOCALHOST_BYPASS=true`.
- **GOTCHA:** `POST /api/session` (used by the API-driven scripts) wants **form fields** (`endpoint_id`, `model`,
  `skip_validation=true`), not JSON — JSON `{}` returns 400 and then `chat_stream` 404s on the bad session id.
- Validate inference cheaply: `POST $OR_BASE/chat/completions` with `max_tokens:10` → expect real content + a tiny
  `usage.cost`.

### 2d. Playwright, sandboxed (browser deps OUT of the project graph)

```bash
mkdir -p .audit-telemetry/shots && printf '\n.audit-telemetry/\n' >> .gitignore   # never commit telemetry
cd .audit-telemetry
printf '{"name":"audit","private":true,"type":"module"}\n' > package.json
npm install playwright@1.49 --prefix "$PWD" --no-audit --no-fund     # --prefix pins it LOCAL (see gotcha)
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$PWD/.pw-browsers" node node_modules/playwright/cli.js install chromium
```

- **GOTCHA:** without `--prefix "$PWD"`, npm walks up and installs Playwright into the **engine's** `package.json`/
  `node_modules` — polluting the project. If that happens: `git checkout package.json package-lock.json`, then
  reinstall local. Keep `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` inside the sandbox.
- **GOTCHA:** match the browser build to the pinned Playwright (1.49 ⇒ chromium build 1148). A mismatched download
  errors at launch; just run the `... cli.js install chromium` for the pinned version.

---

## 3. Reaching game state (no live job boards, etc. — this is Orwell)

- **Create a season fast (debug door):** `POST /api/orwell/new-game` is admin-gated and bypasses the in-chat
  casting interview — `{"playerName":"Avery Quinn","archetype":"social","strategyStyle":"social","seed":51000,
  "confirm":true}`. Great for populating the cast/HUD instantly. `confirm:true` replaces a started game.
- **The roster is engine truth:** `GET /api/orwell/state` → `house[].name` (e.g. Taylor Wong, Summer Mccann, …).
  **Memorize this list** — it is the yardstick for the most important bug class (the model inventing houseguests, §9 B4/B6).
- **GOTCHA — the desync that wasted a run:** creating a game via the debug door while a **casting-interview chat
  session** is open leaves the GM stuck re-casting ("I need to know who you are…"). FIX: start a **fresh chat
  session** (click `#sidebar-new-chat-btn`, or create one via API) — it picks up the live in-game moment prompt.
- **GOTCHA — send trigger:** in the composer, typing flips `.send-btn` `data-mode` from `newchat`→`send`; **Enter
  fires `chat_stream`** once there's text. Do NOT click "New Chat" then immediately Enter — the first Enter can be
  swallowed. (`playSession.mjs`/`gameLoopUI.mjs` handle this.)

---

## 4. Phase — the roleplay methodology (the heart of this audit)

**This is a free-text role-playing game. Embody a consistent identity and play it for real.** Pushing the game
along quickly and artificially (mechanical "continue / advance" nudges) **defeats the purpose** — it skips the
actual experience and won't surface persona/grounding bugs. Instead:

- **Pick a persona and keep it consistent.** Ours: *Avery Quinn — 30, debate coach from Dayton, OH; warm but
  calculating "kitchen spy"; social/relationship game; witty, self-aware voice; loyal to earned trust.* Write
  every player turn **in that voice, reacting to what the house actually said.**
- **Test, every turn:** (a) **persona consistency** — do NPCs keep distinct, stable voices across turns? does the
  GM honor your choices/backstory? (b) **engine grounding** — do the names/outcomes match the engine? (c) **leaks**
  — does any production machinery reach the chat? (d) **UI** — screenshot each beat; check overflow/overlap/contrast.
- **Don't fix mid-play.** Keep a running **defect log** (`/tmp/play/buglog.md`): id, severity, evidence. Fix in a
  batch at season end, then re-run.

### The interactive session daemon (`playSession.mjs`)

Browser automation is one-shot per script, but roleplay needs a **persistent** session you drive turn-by-turn. The
daemon keeps Chromium + the chat session alive and talks over a **file mailbox**:

```
write  /tmp/play/req.json  = {"n":<int>,"text":"<your in-character player line>"}
daemon sends it (agent mode), waits for the GM reply to FINISH, resolves any decision/ask_user card,
then writes /tmp/play/resp.json = {n, gm:<visible message>, leak:<match|null>, card, status:{week,phase,hoh,noms,pending}, shot}
plus a full-page screenshot at .audit-telemetry/shots/play/turn-NN.png
```

Per turn: write `req.json` with the next `n`; `until`-loop until `resp.json.n == n`; read the GM text; **compose
your next line in persona**; repeat. (See the committed `playSession.mjs`.)

- **GOTCHA — the "Thinking" trap:** the naive "wait until message length is stable" latches onto the streaming
  **"Thinking ▅▄▃" placeholder** and captures mid-stream. The fixed `waitDone` waits for the completion **footer**
  (tok/s) AND a non-placeholder body. Use it.
- **Visible vs. reasoning:** strip `.thinking-content` (the collapsible `<think>` block, toggle in Settings →
  Appearance, **on by default**) before judging a leak — a leak in the **player-visible message** is the bug; a
  mention buried in hidden reasoning is secondary (but note it).

---

## 5. Defect taxonomy & verification techniques

| Class | How to detect |
|---|---|
| **Houseguest invention** (worst) | Compare every name the GM uses against `GET /api/orwell/state house[].name`. Any name not on the roster is fabricated. |
| **Engine bypass** (worst) | After the GM narrates an outcome (comp winner / nominee / evictee), read `GET /api/orwell/status`. If `hoh/noms/phase` didn't change, the model invented the result — the engine was never consulted. |
| **Machinery leak** | Regex the **visible** message (sans `.thinking-content`) for: `engine, advanceGame, game state/status, submitDecision, runCompetition, pending, "the player has", "let me check/record/see", "next beat"`. |
| **Decision double-surface** | A binding choice appearing as BOTH the structured `#orwell-decision-card` AND the model's `.ask-user-card`. |
| **Layout: overflow/overlap** | In-page: `scrollWidth>clientWidth`; element right-edge > viewport; a fixed element covering the composer/messages. `getBoundingClientRect` can lie when a `<button>` won't grow to wrapped text — compare `scrollHeight` vs `clientHeight` and **eyeball a crop** (see below). |
| **Copy** | space-before-punct, double-space, kebab slugs rendered as labels, leaked jargon. Dump `page.innerText` per surface and proofread. |
| **Console/page errors** | Collect `pageerror` + `console.error` per surface (some JS crashes surface as UI text). |

- **Screenshot reading:** full-page PNGs of a long chat scale to an unreadable thumbnail. **Crop** the region of
  interest with Pillow (the FE venv has it) and read the crop:
  `from PIL import Image; Image.open(p).crop((0,int(h*0.45),w,h)).save('crop.png')`.
- **Breakpoints:** capture Desktop 1440×900 + Mobile 375×812 for every state; on mobile the sidebar is a drawer
  behind `#hamburger-btn`.

## 6. The loop (per the campaign rhythm)

`stand up stack → configure key in Settings → roleplay a persona deep into a season → log every defect (don't
fix mid-play) → at season end, BATCH-fix at the right altitude → re-verify (re-capture / re-roleplay) → repeat.`

**Remediation altitude (front-end):** design tokens / `:root` in `style.css` → shared component classes → the
specific component's CSS/JS → (last resort) inline dimensions. **Engine-side** user-facing strings & the GM prompt
live in `src/engine/momentPrompts.ts` (rebuild + restart the engine after editing). Keep the diff minimal; reuse
existing classes. Validate: `node --check` edited JS, re-capture the surface, and run the green-increment gates
(`npm test` for the engine; `frontend` pytest for FE).

**Review surface:** focused commits on the working branch + a single PR (the diff *is* the review). End commit
messages with the repo's required trailers.

---

## 7. The harness scripts (in this folder — copy into `.audit-telemetry/` to run)

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lib.mjs` | capture helpers: full-page PNGs at both breakpoints, the in-page **defect scan** (overflow/offscreen/whitespace/tap-targets), innerText dump, optional API login. |
| `playSession.mjs` | the **interactive roleplay daemon** (mailbox protocol, robust `waitDone`, decision/ask_user auto-resolve, per-turn leak check + screenshot). |
| `namesCheck.mjs` | single clean API turn that **forces a named scene** and checks GM names vs the engine roster. |
| `coreScenes.mjs` / `gameScenes.mjs` / `state1.mjs` | scripted captures of login/home/settings/themes and the game windows (cast, finale, decision card, social, diary, status HUD). |
| `gameLoopUI.mjs` | a *mechanical* through-the-UI driver (sends agent turns, answers cards/ask_user) — useful to confirm the engine integration works under explicit prompting, and to reach late states fast. **Not** a substitute for persona roleplay. |
| `mirror_live_parity.mjs` + `run_mirror_gate.sh` | the **F5 two-window live-parity gate** (§10) — boots the stack + a deterministic streamed fake model and asserts window B mirrors window A's **LIVE** render (renders DURING A's stream, through the same incremental renderer), not just the settled transcript. Model-independent, no key. Sends a **warm-up** turn first so B is a pre-subscribed mirror, and widens A's reply stream (`FAKE_TOKEN_DELAY_MS`, default 300 ms) so the gate is host-speed-independent (§10 "Timing model"). Self-test knobs: `MIRROR_B_CPU_THROTTLE=N`, `MIRROR_SKIP_WARMUP=1`. |
| `mirror_hud_parity.mjs` (via `run_mirror_gate.sh MIRROR_HUD=1`) | the **F5 status/gadget-half gate** (§10a, 0064 §B/D) — same stack; after A sends a chat turn that **mutates** engine state (confirmed via engine `beatSeq` before/after), asserts window B's HUD reconciles off the **server push** (the `sync:game-updated` orwell:gamechanged event — never the poll) within `HUD_PARITY_BUDGET_MS`. Model-independent, no key. |

All scripts read secrets from `.audit-telemetry/.secrets.env` (`ADMIN_USER/ADMIN_PW/OR_KEY/OR_BASE/OR_MODEL`) and
write to `.audit-telemetry/shots/`. They are committed here **as reference tooling**; the runtime sandbox, browsers,
secrets, and screenshots stay git-ignored.

---

## 8. Operational gotchas (hard-won)

- **Container restarts** wipe all running processes (engine/FE/daemon) and in-memory engine game state (FE chat
  sessions + the model config persist in `frontend/data`). On restart: re-`run_in_background` the engine + FE,
  re-login admin, recreate the season. Committed code is safe; push often.
- **`pkill` returns 144** (the signal it sent) and can abort a chained command — run `pkill` on its own line, then
  the next step separately.
- **Don't poll** for background tasks — `until <cond>; do sleep 2; done` as a `run_in_background` job, then act on
  the completion notification. Foreground `sleep 75` is blocked by the harness.
- **The `.welcome-active` composer** sits ~30vh up the page (empty chat) vs bottom-pinned (active chat) — anything
  anchored to the bottom must read `--composer-clearance` (kept synced by `init.js`) and be welcome-state-aware.

---

## 9. Findings ledger — 2026-06-18 run (deepseek-v4-flash)

**Fixed & verified this run (PR #290):** "Bedroom b"→"Bedroom B" (`orwellPresence.roomLabel`); theme kebab labels
(`theme.js`); orphaned settings subtitle (`index.html`); "Wants a word" chip text-overflow (`orwellSocial.js`);
GM machinery leak — hard *NEVER NAME THE MACHINERY* + no-operator-asides rule (`momentPrompts.ts`); presence strip
**docked into the sidebar** as "Where you are" chrome + bottom-slot composer-clearance (`orwellPresence/orwellSlots/
init`); **NAMES ARE FIXED** rule — move-in now uses the real roster (`momentPrompts.ts`).

**Open (fix in the next batch):**

| ID | Sev | Finding | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B6** | **CRITICAL** | In **immersive** roleplay the model narrates the *entire* game — incl. who wins HOH — as fiction and **never consults the engine** (engine stayed `premiere`/`hoh:None` while the GM crowned the player). Defeats engine-authority/anti-sycophancy. | **Not** engine-driven progression (that flattens the dynamic DM nuance the operator wants). Instead: let the model DM within **defined constraints + guardrails**, with **engine error-correction** — e.g. it may NOT narrate a comp/nom/vote result until it has the engine's result; the engine validates and corrects drift (names, outcomes). **Try `deepseek-v4-pro`** (flash was too eager to improv / too weak to obey). |
| B5 | High | Model narrates progression but doesn't `advance` on in-character cues (only on mechanical "run the competition" prompts). | Same fix family as B6. |
| B4 | High | Still invents **new** houseguests mid-scene ("Dante Cross, ex-military") despite NAMES-ARE-FIXED; the fake name then persists. | Roster-validate names (engine error-correction), and/or stronger model. |
| B1 | Med | Residual operator-aside preambles ("let me check…", "the player has…") on some replies. | Stronger model; optional FE strip of a leading meta-sentence. |
| B2 | Med | Binding decisions double-surface (structured card + `ask_user`). | Decide which surface owns binding commitment (ADR 0003 → the structured card). |
| B3 | Med | Eviction sub-loop can loop on `advance` at the goodbye-message stage. | Investigate the advance/pending handshake. |

**What's GOOD (keep):** the casting → move-in experience and the **persona layer** are excellent — distinct,
consistent NPC voices across turns (Taylor warm/perceptive, Cassandra cold/analytical, Summer the silent grinder),
the GM tracks threads and honors the player's backstory, and with the fixes there were **zero machinery leaks** in
a clean 7-turn run. The dynamic, nuanced DM quality is the thing worth protecting — the fix must add guardrails
**around** it, not replace it.

### Update — batch-fix verification (2026-06-18, later)

After the season-1 fixes, a guardrail was added (`FLAVOR vs OUTCOMES` + "runCompetition only previews — you
MUST advanceGame") and the model default set to `deepseek-v4-pro`. Verified across season-1 (flash) and a
season-2 attempt:

- **B6 — substantially FIXED.** With the guardrail, the model sources the comp winner from the engine
  (`runCompetition`) and **no longer hands the player the win** (flash crowned the player; guardrailed flash
  crowned a real roster member — Karl Duncan — with the player mid-pack). Anti-sycophancy restored. ✅
- **B5 — still OPEN.** Even with the strengthened guardrail, **flash never calls `advanceGame`** (0 calls all
  session) — `runCompetition` previews but the board never formally moves (phase stuck at `premiere`). The
  prompt is not enough on flash.
- **B4 — still OPEN on flash.** Rampant cast invention persists (Dante Cross, Angela, Niki).
- **Two confounders that block a clean PRO test (fix these in the harness first):**
  1. **Model-picker inheritance** — new chat sessions reuse the *last-used* model (flash), ignoring the server
     `default_model` (pro). Drive the model picker to select pro, or create the session via the API with
     `model=deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` explicitly (the API path honors it — confirmed).
  2. **Admin-door casting desync** — when the season is created via the debug `new-game` door behind a fresh
     chat session, the model tries to run the *casting interview* first (updateCasting/createCharacter) and
     burns the turn before reaching the comp — so play tests stall in casting and surface reasoning-as-text.
     **Fix:** test through the AUTHENTIC flow — let the model run the in-chat casting interview to
     `createCharacter` (don't pre-create via the door), then play. Or extend the moment prompt so a
     door-created (already-cast) game skips re-casting.

- **Flash-vs-pro verdict (the original question):** flash's prose is excellent and leak-free, but it fails
  engine *discipline* (won't `advanceGame`, invents cast). That justifies escalating to **pro** for grounding-
  critical play. Pro's discipline is **not yet cleanly confirmed** — the clean pro run is blocked by the two
  confounders above; do that next (authentic casting + pinned pro), checking `advanceGame` is called and the
  engine advances comp → nominations with real roster names.

---

## 10. The two-window live-parity gate (F5 / ADR 0012 §3.3 / refactor-roadmap R0)

`mirror_live_parity.mjs` + `run_mirror_gate.sh` are the **executable, model-independent** gate for the
#1 release blocker — **F5 realtime two-window mirror parity**. Where `mirror_filmstrip.mjs` diffs only
the *settled* transcript (and so reports "lockstep PASS" while the live stream grinds), this gate diffs
the **live render behaviour** during streaming, which is exactly where the two FE paths diverge.

**Run (no API key — deterministic fake streamed model):**
```bash
bash docs/audits/playtest-harness/run_mirror_gate.sh
```
It stands up engine + `fake_model_server.mjs` + front-end + a STARTED game, opens two windows on the one
canonical session, sends a turn from A, and asserts B mirrors A's LIVE stream. Exits non-zero on divergence.

**What it asserts** (PASS only if all hold), from the timestamp-aligned DOM filmstrip:
- `bStartsDuringAStream` — B begins rendering the turn WHILE A is still streaming (not blank-then-pop).
- `bUsesIncrementalRenderer` — B mounts the same live streaming container A does (`createStreamRenderer`),
  not a full-`innerHTML`-repaint reconcile (`renderDelta`).
- `lagWithinBudget` — B converges within `MIRROR_LAG_BUDGET_MS` (default 2500) of A's settle.

**Current verdict: GREEN** (render fix 2026-07-09, PR "F5 mirror-parity render-race"; made
host-independent + deterministic 2026-07-10, PR #1276 — see "Timing model" below). R2 already unified the
render PATHS (the source-pin tripwire `test_0012_mirror.py::test_chat_client_mirror_does_not_full_repaint_per_delta`
is green), but the harness stayed RED because of a fast-settle RACE: under the deterministic fake model the
turn often settles before window B finishes attaching, so B's visible bubble came from the
`softReloadHistory`/`selectSession` reconcile (a STATIC `.body`, no `.live-reply-content`), and
`resumeStream`'s own-echo dup-abort then tore down B's incremental holder before it painted — B never
mounted the streaming container (`incrementalStream=false`). The fix scopes that dup-abort to the true
own-echo case (a bubble THIS tab live-rendered) and, for a LATE-ATTACHING OBSERVER whose reconcile already
painted a static from-history bubble (`data-fromHistory="1"`), REMOVES it and replays the terminal-buffered
run through the SHARED incremental renderer (`createStreamRenderer` → `.live-reply-content`) — plus flushes
the buffered paint before the one-burst replay's trailing `[DONE]` breaks the read loop. Representative
GREEN telemetry (deterministic fake, quiet host): A first-render ~1.9 s / settles ~4.1 s; **B first-render
~2.9 s** (DURING A's stream); **A & B `incrementalStream=true`**; mirror lag ~0.3 s.

### Timing model (why the gate is deterministic on ANY host — 2026-07-10, PR #1276)

The original gate measured the **FIRST** turn, where the canonical session binds *mid-turn*
(first-writer-wins on A's send) — so window B starts its canonical-discovery poll COLD at send time.
On a CPU-starved runner (5 heavy procs — engine + fake model + FE + two Chromium windows — on ≤4
cores) that discovery + `/api/chat/resume` attach could slip PAST A's short settle, so B painted a
static `softReloadHistory` reconcile and never mounted the incremental container. That flaked the CI
gate (`bStartsDuringAStream` / `bUsesIncrementalRenderer` false, huge lag) even though the render
PATHS are unified — a **test-timing** hole, not a render regression. The 4× retry masked it unreliably.

The gate now removes that non-determinism by measuring the **STEADY-STATE** mirror (the actual F5
invariant — two windows *already converged* on the shared run), on any host:

1. **Warm-up turn (CP1).** A sends one turn first to BIND the canonical session; the gate then waits
   until B has rendered that reply — proof B has discovered the binding, rebound its SSE channel, and
   converged its view. B is now a genuine **pre-subscribed** live mirror. The measured turn (CP2)
   therefore never pays the cold-start discovery cost. (The first-turn cold-start is a transient the
   product handles by reconcile — B still gets the content, just not live — so it is out of scope for
   the *realtime-mirror* invariant.)
2. **Deterministic stream width.** `fake_model_server.mjs` spaces the REPLY tokens by
   `FAKE_TOKEN_DELAY_MS` (default 300 ms, set by `run_mirror_gate.sh`) so A's reply streams over a
   fixed wall-clock window WIDE enough for B's live `resume` to land mid-stream regardless of host
   speed — a zero-width burst stream is impossible to mirror *live* on a slow box. It changes PACING
   only, never the bytes: both windows still receive identical deltas (mirror byte-identity intact).
3. **Observer-clock catch-up.** The filmstrip's `MutationObserver` stamps each record with
   `Date.now()` *when its callback runs*, which lags the real mutation under load — so a
   `.live-reply-content` mount that truly happened during the stream could be stamped just past a
   tight window. Before draining, the gate WAITS until the film has actually recorded the
   incremental-container mount, and bounds structure-membership by the drain wall. The during-stream
   and lag CHECKS still use the ACCURATE direct-DOM-poll clocks (`aSettleMs` / `bConvergeWall`), so a
   late-STAMPED mount is counted but a genuinely-late render can never sneak past the timing checks.

The three checks and their meaning are UNCHANGED — this only makes the measurement fair. The gate is
**not** gamed green: `.live-reply-content` / `.stream-content` / `.msg-ai.streaming` are mounted ONLY
by the shared incremental renderer (the static reconcile builds a plain `.body`), and two self-test
knobs prove the gate still FAILS a non-mirroring B — `MIRROR_B_CPU_THROTTLE=N` (CDP-throttle B N× to
simulate a contended runner) and `MIRROR_SKIP_WARMUP=1` (measure the cold-start regime). With the
default (widened) stream even a cold, 8×-throttled B mirrors live and PASSES; `MIRROR_SKIP_WARMUP=1
MIRROR_TOKEN_DELAY_MS=0 MIRROR_B_CPU_THROTTLE=8` reproduces the original zero-width cold-start FAIL.
The CI `mirror-parity` job keeps a small retry as belt-and-suspenders, but the gate no longer *relies*
on it. Representative GREEN telemetry (deterministic fake, quiet host): A first-render ~1.5 s / settles
~3.8 s; **B first-render ~2.2 s** (DURING A's stream); **A & B `incrementalStream=true`**; mirror lag
~50 ms — and it stays GREEN under `MIRROR_B_CPU_THROTTLE=8`.

Promoted to a CI gate (`mirror-parity` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, under the `ci-gate` required check,
on the FE-changed path filter) — key-free against the deterministic narrator, like `browser_smoke.py` /
`deploy/smoke.sh`.

## 10a. The two-window HUD-parity gate (F5 status/gadget half · feature 0064 §B/D)

`mirror_hud_parity.mjs` is the **status/gadget complement** to §10's chat-render gate: §10 proves the
two windows mirror the live *narration*; this proves they mirror the *board / HUD* the moment a chat
turn changes it. It targets the gap where the 0064 `game-updated` server-push fired from the
decision/self-eviction routes but **never from the chat-turn path** — so a game turn refreshed only the
sender's HUD and peers stayed stale until their 20–30s poll (observed live: window A "1 of 15 met" /
window B "0 of 15").

**Run (no API key — deterministic fake streamed model):**
```bash
MIRROR_HUD=1 bash docs/audits/playtest-harness/run_mirror_gate.sh
```
Same stack as §10 (engine + fake model + FE + a STARTED game, two windows on one canonical session). It
first sends a **warm-up** framed turn from A so the canonical session binds and BOTH windows subscribe to
its SSE channel (steady state — the real two-window scenario; without it the first framed turn binds the
canonical id mid-turn and the end-of-turn push races ahead of the peers' not-yet-existing subscription,
a first-turn artifact). Then A sends the **measured** mutating turn.

**Mutation source (key-free):** the measured turn is a long player line with no model write tool, so the
**0055 `_auto_record_scene` belt** (`ensure_turn_recorded` → `recordInteraction`) fires and commits an
engine mutation (the `beatSeq` bumps). The gate **confirms** the mutation (engine `beatSeq` before/after)
before asserting parity — a non-mutating turn can never yield a false green.

**Measurement (push, not poll):** the 0064 SSE `game-updated` is the **only** thing that dispatches a
`window.orwellGameChanged('sync:game-updated')` (via `sessionSync.js notifyGameUpdated`); the HUD's poll
re-fetches **without** dispatching `orwell:gamechanged`. So the gate taps B's `orwell:gamechanged` carrying
the `sync:game-updated` reason — by construction the push, never the poll — and times it relative to A's
settle (the A↔B parity lag; A refreshes its OWN HUD client-side at settle). **What it asserts** (PASS only
if all hold): `turnMutatedEngine` (the measured turn bumped `beatSeq`), `bReceivedPush` (B got the push),
`parityWithinBudget` (B's reconcile lands within `HUD_PARITY_BUDGET_MS`, default 2000, of A's settle).

**Verdict:** **RED on the base branch** (the chat turn publishes nothing → B never receives a push → it
would only converge on its slow poll); **GREEN** once `chat_routes.py` fires `publish_game_updated_after_turn`
from the DONE seam (gated on the mutation). Representative GREEN telemetry: measured turn beat 2→3, B push
reason `sync:game-updated` at +2044ms while A settled at +4025ms → parity lag 0ms. The fast source-pin
tripwire is `frontend/tests/test_1130_hud_parity_instant.py` (the helper's mutation-gating + the
chat-route source-pin).
