# Implementation queue — prompts for Claude Code & OpenHands

Dispatch these to implementer agents **in order** (respecting `depends on`). Items on different
tracks can run **in parallel** once their deps are met.

**Agent split (suggested, not strict):**
- **Claude Code → the TypeScript engine** (`src/`) — it has built the hexagonal core.
- **OpenHands → the Python front-end** (`frontend/`, vendored Orwell).

**Every prompt assumes these house rules** (state them if the agent is fresh): read `CLAUDE.md`
and the named `docs/features/*` spec first; the **Vault Wall is structural** — no outward module
imports `VaultStore`/`VectorIndex`, and `npm run test:arch` (dependency-cruiser) must stay green;
**BDD/TDD-first** — the `.feature` files are the source of truth, make them green; **name-agnostic
tests** (roles only); keep `npm test` green; commit on a feature branch and **open a PR**.

> ⚠️ **Adjustments to already-built specs — pick these up.** See the
> [Amendments table in `docs/features/README.md`](features/README.md#amendments-to-shipped-specs-implementer-pick-these-up).
> *(The 0004 appearance-fields and 0023 durability rows there are **satisfied — implemented**;
> check the table for any newer, still-open amendments before starting work.)*

> 📸 **2026-06-20 — 0065 photo-first OOBE (engine ✅ done):** the cast photo is now casting **step #1**
> — `castPhoto` (`"uploaded"`/`"skipped"`) is the FIRST `CASTING_COVERAGE` entry, engine-driven and
> OPTIONAL (never gates casting `ready`; `createCharacter` finalizes either way). See the 0050
> [Amendment (0065)](features/0050-casting-interview.md#amendment-0065--the-cast-photo-is-the-first-casting-step-photo-first-oobe).
> The FE Python relay + in-chat photo box build to the same `castPhoto` contract (sibling work).

## Dispatch strategy — HISTORICAL (2026-06-08; complete — dispatch from the audit batches at the bottom)

**State as of 2026-06-08 (since superseded — C8/0032 shipped):**
- **Engine: 0001–0031 are Done.** The consequence loop (0023), soul recall (0024), per-user sandboxes
  (0021), reserve twists (0025), the streaming narrator (0027), durable persistence (0030), relationship
  + temperature constants (0026/0028), and now the **runtime orchestrator/integrity watcher (0031)** are
  all green. **The engine core is complete** — only maintenance + future specs remain.
- **Front-end: the game wiring + accounts tier are live** — onboarding/`X-Orwell-User`, the agent lever
  tools (C6), 0020 player UX (C4), and app admin (0029/C7) have all shipped. **One item remains:**
  **C8 — 0032 surface reduction** (prune the vendored workspace down to the game build).
- **C5 / 0004 appearance / C6 / C4 / C7 are complete.**

Two lanes — **Claude Code = engine (`src/`)**, **OpenHands = front-end (`frontend/`)**. The engine lane
is now drained; the active front-end work is the prune.

| Wave | Claude Code (engine) | OpenHands (front-end) |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — now** | *Engine core complete* — no queued feature. Maintenance, future specs, and any review follow-ups. | **C8** (0032 surface reduction) — reduce the front-end to the **game build**: flag-gate + **server-side 404** every dropped vertical (incl. the live **shell** endpoint), drop front-end memory/RAG, prune Settings tabs, behind one **`ORWELL_GAME_BUILD`** switch; then stop shipping the dropped JS; then delete it (deletion tier **verified on a running instance**). Keep **voice** off-by-default. |
| **after** | Future specs as drafted (jury choreography, MVP-2 engine bits, new product calls). | MVP-2 (0022) un-parks once MVP-1 is solid. |

**Coordination rules**
- **Stay in lanes** (engine `src/` vs front-end `frontend/`); don't cross-edit the other's files.
- **0032 is front-end-only** — it must **not** touch `src/` or `cucumber.cjs`; the engine gate
  (`npm test` / `npm run test:arch`) must stay **unaffected** (the front-end is quarantined).
- **0032 tier order:** Tier 1 (flag-gate + 404) → Tier 2 (stop shipping JS) → Tier 3 (delete code).
  Tiers 1–2 go green in CI (`pytest`); Tier 3's DoD is a **documented run on a live instance** (boots,
  onboards, plays a turn, portraits render, accounts/admin work) per `frontend/INTEGRATION.md`.
- **First move (historical):** OpenHands → **C8** — since shipped. (This block is the 2026-06-08
  record; the live dispatch point is the audit batches at the bottom.)

*(The full per-item prompts are below.)*

## Order & assignment

| # | Item | Agent | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Engine **HTTP MCP transport** | Claude Code | — (McpServer + build/start exist) |
| B5 | Implement **0017 relationship model** | Claude Code | — (`relationships.ts` seam exists) |
| B1 | Implement **0011 weekly loop** | Claude Code | B5 reads it (seam already exists) |
| A2 | **Orwell → engine MCP** client + game driver | OpenHands | A1 |
| B2 | Implement **0012 conversation** (engine side) | Claude Code | B1 |
| B3 | Implement **0013 Diary Room** | Claude Code | B2 |
| B4 | Implement **0014 jury & endgame** | Claude Code | B1, B5 |
| B6 | Implement **0015 OOBE** (engine side) | Claude Code | — (0004 done) |
| B7 | Implement **0016 God Mode / admin** | Claude Code | — (0001 done) |
| C1 | **BB player surfaces** in Orwell | OpenHands | A2, B2 |
| C2 | **OOBE authoring UI** in Orwell | OpenHands | A2, B6 |
| A3 | **Deploy smoke test** | either | A1, A2 |

A1 + B5 start immediately in parallel (one per agent). A2 unblocks the whole front-end track.
**B5 (relationship model) is foundational** — do it early; B1 and B4 read it. B6/B7 are
independent of the gameplay chain (their deps are already green) and can slot into any free
Claude Code slot.

## Progress (this session — onboarding vertical slice)

A first end-to-end slice fixing "no onboarding past account creation" and "the model answers as
a generic assistant" is **landed** (engine tested green; front-end bridge wired):

- **A1 — HTTP MCP transport:** ✅ confirmed present (`HttpMcpServer.ts`); engine port aligned to
  `ORWELL_ENGINE_PORT` (8765) to match the deploy/front-end contract.
- **B6 — engine OOBE:** ✅ exposed as Vault-free player tools `createCharacter` / `getGameState`,
  plus `getMomentPrompt` (managed per-moment system prompt). Tested (unit + HTTP + sentinel/arch).
- **A2 / C2 — front-end:** ✅ first slice — `/orwell` page (character creation → house → in-character
  chat) + `routes/orwell_routes.py` + `src/orwell_engine.py`; chat injects the engine's moment prompt
  via Orwell's own `resolve_endpoint`/`llm_call_async`. See `frontend/INTEGRATION.md` → "Try it".

Remaining on these: deeper agent/tool-calling integration (let the LLM *call* engine action tools,
not just narrate), surfacing `/orwell` from the main nav/landing, and the weekly-loop moments
(feature 0011) that will advance phase/moment automatically.

## Prompts

### A1 — Engine HTTP MCP transport  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell` (TypeScript engine), implement an **HTTP MCP transport** that exposes the
> existing `McpServer` (`src/adapters/mcp/McpServer.ts`) over HTTP per the MCP spec (JSON-RPC, with
> SSE for streaming). Requirements: listen on **`ORWELL_ENGINE_PORT`** (default 8765, loopback by
> default); be started by **`npm start`** (build/start already exist); mount **only** the
> per-channel allowlist via `toolsFor(channel)`; **never** add a Vault-reading tool. Read
> `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/features/0009-mcp-tool-boundary.md` first. Keep the Vault Wall: the
> transport module must not import `VaultStore`/`VectorIndex`/the engine root — `npm run test:arch`
> stays green. Add tests: an MCP client lists tools and calls each over HTTP and never receives
> Vault data (extend the sentinel/architecture tests). Keep `npm test` green. Open a PR.

### B1 — Implement 0011 weekly loop  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement feature **0011** (`docs/features/0011-weekly-loop-orchestration.{md,feature}`)
> in the **pure domain core**: the weekly phase state machine (HOH → nominations → veto → veto
> ceremony → eviction → repeat) and the season → Final 2 → jury vote → winner. NPC decisions are
> **relationship-driven** (use the existing `src/engine/relationships.ts`); player decision points
> are surfaced and **validated against feature 0005**; jury = the last 9 evictees; last-juror
> tie-break. Pure + **seed-deterministic**. Make the `0011` `.feature` green and keep all gates
> green. Read `CLAUDE.md` first. Open a PR.

### A2 — Orwell → engine MCP client + game driver  ·  OpenHands

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, wire the vendored **Orwell** front-end (`frontend/`, Python FastAPI +
> agent) to drive a *Big Brother* game through the engine's **MCP server**. Read
> `frontend/INTEGRATION.md`, `docs/features/0009-mcp-tool-boundary.md`, and
> `docs/features/0012-conversation-and-scene-system.md`. Tasks: (1) register the engine MCP server
> (URL from env **`ORWELL_ENGINE_MCP_URL`**) as a tool backend for Orwell's agent — it already
> supports MCP (`frontend/routes/mcp_routes.py`, `frontend/mcp_servers/`); (2) add a "Big Brother"
> game session where the agent drives play by calling the engine tools (`getVisibleStateFor`,
> `renderScene`, `recordInteraction`, `resolveCompetition`, `surfaceInformationTo`) and Orwell's
> existing LLM connection (Ollama/Anthropic) **narrates** the returned, Vault-free context;
> (3) **hybrid** interaction — free-text social play, but binding decisions (nominate / veto /
> vote) are explicit, validated tool calls. **Hard constraint:** the front-end consumes **only**
> what the MCP tools return — it never reaches the engine's Vault. Done when: from the Orwell UI
> you start a game, get narration, take a turn, and no Vault data appears. Open a PR.

### B2 — Implement 0012 conversation (engine side)  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement the engine side of feature **0012**
> (`docs/features/0012-conversation-and-scene-system.{md,feature}`): `recordInteraction` (scenes as
> witnessed events — player-present = player knowledge, per 0002), a **`socialRead`** player tool
> (joins the registry with `readsVault: false`; honest, Vault-free, may hint but never names
> off-screen events), and **explicit decision validation** (binding choices go through a validated
> path, never parsed from prose; illegal choices rejected per 0005). NPC dialogue must be
> constrained to what that NPC legitimately knows (0002). Make the `0012` `.feature` green; gates
> green. Open a PR.

### B3 — Implement 0013 Diary Room  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement feature **0013** (`docs/features/0013-diary-room.{md,feature}`):
> the player DR is OOC, its content is player knowledge tagged **`NO_NPC_PATHWAY`**, and
> `deriveNpcKnowledge` must **exclude** it (no NPC ever learns DR content); honor the public/private
> gap (NPCs act on public speech, never the DR); NPC confessionals are **Vault-only** and never
> surface (sentinel-clean). Make the `0013` `.feature` green; gates green. Open a PR.

### B4 — Implement 0014 jury & endgame  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement feature **0014** (`docs/features/0014-jury-and-endgame.{md,feature}`):
> jury = last 9 evictees; **jury management** shapes votes (relationship + eviction manner); Final 2
> choreography (statements, one question per juror); the **engine decides** the vote (LLM only
> voices), jury-management-dominant with a tunable finale weight; most votes wins, last-juror
> tie-break. Make the `0014` `.feature` green; gates green. Open a PR.

### C1 — BB player surfaces in Orwell  ·  OpenHands

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell` `frontend/`, adapt Orwell's chat shell into the *Big Brother* player
> experience: a **narrated scene** view, the **hybrid decision prompts** (nominate / veto / vote
> over the legal option set returned by the engine), a **Diary Room** panel, and a
> **house / houseguest** view. Consume **only** MCP tool data (visible projection) — never the
> Vault. Keep the existing chat/LLM/agent plumbing. Open a PR.

### A3 — Deploy smoke test  ·  either

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, add an **install smoke test** for `deploy/`: provision a container (a real
> Proxmox LXC, or a Docker/Debian stand-in for CI), run `deploy/orwell-install.sh`, assert the UI
> responds on `ORWELL_PORT`, run `deploy/orwell-update.sh`, and assert `/opt/orwell/data` survived.
> Document how to run it on a real Proxmox host. Open a PR.

### B5 — Implement 0017 relationship model  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement feature **0017** (`docs/features/0017-relationship-model.{md,feature}`),
> promoting `docs/decisions/0002-relationship-model.md` into the pure domain core (build on the
> existing `src/engine/relationships.ts`). Relationships are **directed, graded, asymmetric edges**
> (trust / affinity / threat / alignment / reliability / confidence) **computed from event history**
> through the holder's `Character` framing — **never** a binary ally/enemy flag, and **no label is
> ever persisted**. Fix the *shape* per the spec (recency-weighting, **betrayal-shock**, **decay**,
> rising confidence with data, dispositional labels); the **numbers are tunable config** alongside
> the temperature constants (0006). Wire the consumers: Houseguest's Choice (0005), targeting via
> `threat`, jury lean (feeds 0014). Pure + **seed-deterministic**. Make the `0017` `.feature` green;
> keep all gates green (esp. that the serialized soul holds signals+history but **no label** — ties
> 0007). Read `CLAUDE.md` first. Open a PR.

### B6 — Implement 0015 OOBE (engine side)  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement the engine side of feature **0015**
> (`docs/features/0015-character-creation-oobe.{md,feature}`): `runPlayerOOBE(input)` — validate the
> input, reject incomplete profiles, and produce the player's **static `Character`** + **initial
> `Soul`** (emotional baseline + volatility, empty memory, **no** relationship beliefs); then seed
> the house **around** the authored player via `generateHouse(seed, player)` keeping the curated
> ensemble (0004). **Anti-sycophancy is the crux:** the player's P/M/S aptitudes must fall **within
> the same bounds as the NPCs** — no self-min-maxing (ship §9 option **A**, derived/balanced, unless
> told otherwise); the player carries **no** outcome guarantee (0006). The player's authored private
> strategy is player knowledge tagged **`NO_NPC_PATHWAY`** (0013) — no NPC starts knowing it. OOBE
> is OOC (no witnessed event). Make the `0015` `.feature` green; gates green. Read `CLAUDE.md` first.
> Open a PR.

### B7 — Implement 0016 God Mode / admin  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement feature **0016** (`docs/features/0016-god-mode-admin.{md,feature}`),
> extending the existing `src/surfaces/admin/AdminPort.ts` and the `ADMIN_TOOLS` allowlist. Add
> useful **non-Vault** admin capability — `overrideMechanic`, `configure` (tunable constants +
> reserve-twist **count**, never content), `manageSandbox` (create/reset/save/load this sandbox) —
> while keeping the **Vault Wall on the admin surface**: no admin module imports `VaultStore`/
> `VectorIndex` (extend the dependency-cruiser rule to `surfaces/admin`), every `ADMIN_TOOLS` entry
> stays `readsVault: false`, and admin output is **sentinel-clean** (extend the 0001 canary to the
> admin surface). Enabling reserve twists must **not** reveal their content/timing to the admin
> (Vault-sealed, 0005). Make the `0016` `.feature` green; gates green. Read `CLAUDE.md` and
> `docs/features/0001-vault-wall-isolation.md` first. Open a PR.

### C2 — OOBE authoring UI in Orwell  ·  OpenHands

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell` `frontend/`, add the **character-creation (OOBE) flow** to the Orwell UI:
> a first-run, out-of-character intake that collects the player's identity, backstory, public
> persona, archetype lean, and private strategy, validates required fields, and calls the engine's
> OOBE entrypoint (via the MCP client from A2) to author the player and start a new save. Consume
> **only** what the engine returns; the UI never sets the player's stats directly (the engine
> balances them — anti-sycophancy). Keep the existing chat/LLM/agent plumbing. Open a PR.

## Batch 2 — features 0015–0020, in build sequence

0011–0014 + A1 are **built**; the **rename** (BBAI→Orwell) and the **"Orwell IS the game" fold**
are in flight (their own prompts, given separately). This batch finishes the gameplay + player
experience. Build in this order — two agents in parallel where deps allow:

| Step | Item | Agent | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **B5** — 0017 relationship model | Claude Code | — (foundational; 0014/0019 read it) |
| 2 | **B8** — 0018 moment orchestration | Claude Code | 0011/0008/0009 (done) |
| 3 | **B6** — 0015 OOBE  +  **B9** — 0004 appearance amendment | Claude Code | 0004; pair B6+B9 (same factory) |
| 4 | **B7** — 0016 God Mode | Claude Code | 0001 (done) — slot anytime |
| 5 | **B10** — 0019 engine decision seam | Claude Code | B5, B8, 0011/0005 |
| 6 | **C3** — 0019 agent play loop | OpenHands | B10 + the fold + 0012 |
| 7 | **B11** — 0020 engine (status + portrait descriptor) | Claude Code | B9 |
| 8 | **C4** — 0020 player UX (panel + decisions + portraits) | OpenHands | B11, C3 |

Claude Code runs the engine track (B5 → B8 → B6/B9 → B7 → B10 → B11); OpenHands picks up C3 once
B10 lands, then C4 once B11 lands. **B5/B6/B7 prompts are above; the new ones (B8–B11, C3–C4):**

### B8 — 0018 narrative & moment orchestration  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/bbai`, implement feature **0018** (`docs/features/0018-narrative-moment-orchestration.{md,feature}`)
> in the engine, promoting the existing `src/engine/momentPrompts.ts` + the `getMomentPrompt` tool
> into a tested spec. The **engine owns the moment** — derive it deterministically from the
> phase/schedule (0011/0008); the narrator can't change it. The managed `MOMENT_PROMPTS` registry
> is the single place for per-moment fragments; the composed prompt = base game-master persona +
> moment fragment + **Vault-free** context (player card + house names + phase). Persona/framing
> ONLY — never the Vault Wall. Make `0018` green: every moment's prompt is **sentinel-free** under a
> fully populated Vault (extend the 0001 canary to `getMomentPrompt`); the moment tracks the engine
> phase; the base persona forbids generic-assistant output; the context carries no stats/souls/
> archetypes/hidden. Keep all gates green. Open a PR.

### B9 — 0004 appearance amendment  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/bbai`, fold the **0004 amendment** into the built `CharacterFactory`
> (`src/engine/characterFactory.ts`): generate **public appearance/identity** fields (appearance,
> approximate age, presentation/style) into the static `Character`, seeded, internally consistent
> with the archetype, **seed-stable** (part of the byte-stable baseline, 0007), and carrying **no**
> P/M/S aptitude or hidden data. These are the Vault-free facets the portrait descriptor (0020)
> reads. Make the new `0004` appearance scenario green (see `docs/features/0004-replayability-and-naming.md`
> §8); keep all gates green. Best paired with **B6** (0015 OOBE) since both touch the factory. Open a PR.

### B10 — 0019 engine decision seam  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/bbai`, implement the **engine** side of feature **0019**
> (`docs/features/0019-agent-driven-play-loop.{md,feature}`): a Vault-free decision seam the agent
> drives — `pendingDecision(state) -> { kind, options[] } | none` returning the engine's **legal**
> option set (per 0011/0005), and `executeDecision(kind, choice)` that **validates** and applies a
> binding choice (rejecting illegal/ineligible per 0005), exposed as player-channel tools
> (`readsVault: false`). Binding state changes happen **only** through this path — never parsed
> from prose; the engine decides outcomes (0006/0011/0014), the agent only voices. Much of
> `pendingDecision`/advance likely already exists in the 0011 weekly loop — reuse it. Make the
> engine-side `0019` scenarios green; gates green. Open a PR.

### B11 — 0020 engine: status + portrait descriptor  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/bbai`, implement the **engine** bits of feature **0020**
> (`docs/features/0020-player-experience.{md,feature}`): a Vault-free **`gameStatus()`** projection
> for the status panel — `{ week, phase, hoh, nominees[], veto: { holder, used } }`, public
> ceremony-level facts only (no hidden votes/targeting), as a player-channel tool
> (`readsVault: false`); and **`portraitDescriptorFor(houseguest)`** — a Vault-free descriptor
> built from `character.md`'s **public appearance facets** (the B9 amendment), excluding aptitudes,
> hidden elements, and `Soul`/Vault. Both **sentinel-clean** under a populated Vault (extend the
> 0001 canary). Make the engine-side `0020` scenarios green; gates green. Depends on **B9**. Open a PR.

### C3 — 0019 agent play loop  ·  OpenHands

> In `kevinhirsch/bbai` `frontend/`, implement the **agent turn-loop** of feature **0019** in
> orwell: the agent drives each turn by calling the engine's Vault-free tools — read visible state,
> narrate the moment (inject `getMomentPrompt`, 0018), and when `pendingDecision` returns options,
> present them and execute the player's binding choice via the validated `executeDecision` (B10).
> **Hybrid input:** free-text social play flows in the chat (recorded as witnessed events, 0012)
> and never makes a binding decision; only the validated path does. The agent **never** invents
> outcomes — it voices what the engine returns. Consume only Vault-free tool data. This runs inside
> the "Orwell IS the game" fold (the game is the main chat). Open a PR.

### C4 — 0020 player experience (MVP-1)  ·  OpenHands

> In `kevinhirsch/bbai` `frontend/`, build **player experience MVP-1** (feature 0020) in orwell: a
> light always-visible **status panel** fed by `gameStatus` (week/phase, HOH & nominees, veto
> status — public only); **inline quick-buttons** for binding decisions rendered from the engine's
> **legal** option set (`pendingDecision`) and executed via the validated path (never typed prose);
> and **photo-style portraits** per houseguest, rendered by orwell's existing image-gen pipeline
> from the engine's **`portraitDescriptorFor`** (B11) — public facets only. Everything shown is
> Vault-free; **"your own standing" stays in narration, not the HUD**. Depends on **B11** + **C3**.
> Open a PR. *(MVP-2 — the rich game UI, feature 0022 — is **deferred**; MVP-1 is being refined.)*

### B12 — 0021 engine: per-user sandbox registry  ·  Claude Code

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, implement the **engine** side of feature **0021**
> (`docs/features/0021-game-session-and-save-lifecycle.{md,feature}`): turn the single in-memory
> game into a **per-user sandbox registry** — `sandboxFor(user) -> GameSession` (created on first
> use) — and route **every** player/admin MCP tool call to the asserting user's sandbox (the MCP
> layer resolves the user identity the front-end asserts). **One active game per user**
> (`createCharacter` replaces that user's own game); **unlimited users concurrently**, each fully
> isolated. **Cross-user isolation is the crux:** no call on behalf of user A may return any of
> user B's state — add a **cross-user sentinel test** (mirror the 0001 Vault canary on the user
> axis: seed A's game with sentinels, assert none appear in any of B's tool outputs, and vice-
> versa). The Vault Wall (0001) must still hold inside each sandbox; `npm run test:arch` stays
> green. Make the `0021` engine scenarios green; gates green. **Do this early** — it reshapes the

### C5 — 0021 front-end: assert the authenticated user  ·  OpenHands

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell` `frontend/`, make the front-end **assert the authenticated user identity**
> to the engine on every engine MCP call (the engine binds loopback and keys a sandbox per user —
> B12). Use the already-authenticated account (`request.state.current_user`) as the sandbox key;
> never let one account act as another. Each user sees only **their** game — the chat is their
> window. Done when two logged-in users each get their own isolated game and neither can see the

### C6 — Tight, lever-complete system prompts  ·  OpenHands (+ Claude Code)  ·  **HISTORICAL — shipped (was "START NOW")**

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, make the game agent able to **access and pull every engine lever**. The
> engine's game-master prompt (`src/engine/momentPrompts.ts`, 0018) is already a **tight operating
> manual** that names the levers and says the engine decides outcomes; this closes the gaps around
> it. **Ready part — do now:** the drift test (3) and exposing the two levers that already exist —
> `getVisibleStateFor`, `socialRead` — in (1). The decision levers (0019) and `gameStatus` (0020)
> get exposed as they land (the drift test forces it). Steps:
> 1. **Front-end — expose the full lever set as agent tools.** `frontend/src/agent_tools.py`
>    (`TOOL_TAGS`) + `frontend/src/tool_schemas.py` currently expose only `getGameState`,
>    `runCompetition`, `recordInteraction`, `surfaceInformationTo`. Add the rest the agent should
>    drive — `getVisibleStateFor`, `socialRead`, and (as they land) `pendingDecision` /
>    `executeDecision` (0019) and `gameStatus` (0020) — each as a clean function schema so the
>    model knows **how to access** every lever.
> 2. **Front-end — inject the lever-aware prompt.** Confirm `frontend/routes/chat_helpers.py`
>    injects the engine's `getMomentPrompt` (0018) as the system message on every game turn.
> 3. **Engine — keep the manifest honest.** Mark which `registry.ts` entries are **agent levers**
>    (e.g. an `agentLever: true` field on the game-driving read/action tools — not infra like
>    `getMomentPrompt`/`endOfSessionSummary`), then add a test that **fails if any agent-lever tool
>    is missing from the base prompt's manifest**, so the prompt and the registry never drift.
> Done when the model reliably reads state, resolves comps, records scenes, surfaces info, and
> takes binding decisions **through the engine** — and never invents an outcome. Read

## Post-audit feature batch (0038–0044) · all Claude Code (engine)

A behavioral-fidelity / anti-sycophancy audit (transcript) found several capabilities **built but unwired**
and two genuine gaps. These specs close them. Build priority: **0038 first** (biggest "feels flat" risk,
pure wiring), then 0039 & 0040 (genuine gaps), then 0041/0042/0043/0044.

### B27 — 0038 live off-screen society  ·  **✅ DONE (B27a + B27b, 2026-06-10)**

> **B27b shipped with B70's PR.** `diffuseGossip` is wired into the live off-screen tick: a rumor RISES from a
> scene occasionally (`GOSSIP.riseProb`), travels the AFFINITY graph (who actually talks to whom; the player is
> a node) with low per-edge transmission, decaying confidence and per-telling drift, and lands on the player —
> when a chain terminates there — as a belief with source+confidence. The rumor is a vague PARAPHRASE
> (`rumorFrom` + `RUMOR_GLOSS`), never the verbatim hidden scene; retelling events are recipient-specific (the
> B64 twin-content lesson). The 0031 leak heuristic is PATHWAY-AWARE: hidden content covered by the player's
> legitimate pathway-borne facts is not a leak — the checkpoint commits legal propagation; the 0001 canary stays
> the precise guard. 0035 + 0038 are now in `cucumber.cjs` (11 new scenarios). `tests/unit/liveGossip.test.ts`.

> **B27a (DONE):** the orchestrator's live off-screen tick (`Orchestrator.defaultApply`) now runs
> `richOffscreenStretch` — **seven varied interaction types** folded into the relationship layer by their true
> nature (was a 4-verb stub). Bounded/seeded/Vault-walled/isolated; unit-gated (`offscreenSociety.test.ts`).
>
> **B27b (remaining) — see `docs/features/0038-…md` §8 for the full design.** (1) **live gossip→player
> diffusion**: the fix is (a) make the **0031 leak heuristic pathway-aware** — flag a hidden event's content
> as a leak only if it appears in the player projection AND is **not covered by the player's legitimate
> `KnowledgeService` facts** (gossip "told-by"/"overheard"/"surfaced" pathways); the **0001 sentinel canary
> stays** the precise guard; (b) keep the rumor a **vague paraphrase** (never the verbatim hidden scene);
> (c) wire `diffuseGossip` into the off-screen tick over a house graph with a **low transmit probability**
> (partial, distorted spread), reaching the player only via a terminating pathway as a belief with
> source+confidence. **Acceptance:** a rumor reaches the player AND the 0031 checkpoint still commits (no
> false leak) AND the 0001 canary stays green. (2) **soul deepening** is **feature 0041**. Then add 0035 +
> 0038 to `cucumber.cjs`. Gates green. Open a PR.

### B28 — 0039 promise & deal tracking

> Implement `docs/features/0039-promise-and-deal-tracking.{md,feature}`. Add a first-class `Deal` model
> (parties/terms/condition/status); make player↔NPC deals (recorded knowledge) + NPC↔NPC deals (Vault-held);
> **reconcile** open deals against binding actions (engine-decided kept/broken, never prose); on break apply
> the **betrayal-shock** fold (0026) + a jury-management demerit (0014) + a witnessed reveal. Persisted (0030);
> Vault-walled (NPC↔NPC reach the player only by 0038 rumor). Add to `cucumber.cjs`. Open a PR.

### B29 — 0040 NPC Diary Room confessionals  ·  **DONE (core)**

> ✅ `src/engine/confessionals.ts` (`confessionalFor` + `recordConfessional`): an engine-grounded private read
> (top-threat target + strongest bond, from the relationship signals — not invented), recorded **Vault-only**
> (hidden, `witnessSet:[npc]`); wired into the live off-screen tick. Proven **walled from the player AND the
> admin** (the admin surface reads no events) + seed-deterministic — `tests/unit/npcConfessionals.test.ts` (5).
> **Remaining:** the **soul-recall feedback** (grounding the NPC's later voice) needs a `SoulStore` in the live
> sandbox — **feature 0041**; optionally fire confessionals specifically at nomination/eviction beats (today
> the trigger is the off-screen tick).

### B30 — 0041 character evolution & season arc  ·  **LINCHPIN (unblocks 0038 + 0040 soul pieces)** — ✅ DONE

> **DONE.** `SoulStore` is wired into the live `EngineCore`/`buildEngineCore` (deterministic embed),

### B31 — 0042 competition library  ·  **✅ DONE 2026-06-10**

> **Built to green.** New `src/engine/competitionLibrary.ts`: a curated, tunable `COMPETITION_LIBRARY`
> (12 `CompetitionDef`s — 6 HOH + 6 veto: name, phase, the existing resolution `type` with its `governing`

> (seeded; avoids the last `NO_REPEAT_WINDOW` per phase). `liveSeason.ts` replaced the hardcoded
> `HOH_TYPES`/`VETO_TYPES` week-index rotation: the comp is drawn FIRST on the beat rng (so `advance` and

> and a Houseguest's-Choice pause stores the drawn def id (`vetoComp`) so the resume runs the SAME comp.
> Resolution math untouched (0006/0028 — the engine still decides; favorite calibrated, player unprotected).
> `CompetitionResultView` gained optional `name`/`format`/`narrative` (no stat/score — the 0001 canary
> extended to the enriched view); the 0034 deep-game BDD fixtures repointed to seed 5 (the reshuffle moved
> which seeds run deep). `tests/unit/competitionLibrary.test.ts` (11) + all 6 BDD scenarios in `cucumber.cjs`.
> Original prompt below.

> Implement `docs/features/0042-competition-library.{md,feature}`. A seeded, tunable `COMPETITION_LIBRARY` of
> `CompetitionDef`s (name, governing/secondary stat, format, Vault-free narrative scaffold) + a deterministic
> `drawCompetition(phase, week, rng, recent)` (no immediate repeats) replacing the hardcoded `HOH_TYPES`/

### B32 — 0043 emergent multi-party bloc behavior  ·  **✅ DONE 2026-06-10**

> **Built to green.** New `src/engine/blocs.ts`: `detectBlocs` clusters the LIVE relationship graph at decision

### B33 — 0044 strategic nomination & vote refinements  ·  **✅ DONE 2026-06-10**

> **Built to green.** `src/engine/decisionConstants.ts` is the single tunable module (sibling to 0026/0028 —

## Still on the feature-maker (me) — HISTORICAL (superseded 2026-06-10)

> **HISTORICAL (E87d):** this block is a point-in-time snapshot from mid-build and contradicts the
> drained-queue banner — everything it lists as "remaining" subsequently shipped (0037 UI/B26+C11,
> B27b, 0039–0044, the audit batches) except **0022**, which stays the one deferred feature. Kept
> verbatim below for the record; trust the per-item ✅ stamps and `cucumber.cjs`, not this prose.

**0001–0036 are built** (0022 deferred). The "continue all wiring" batch shipped the engine + API wiring:
**B24/0035** (SystemClock + `composeRuntime` start the off-screen watcher in `main.ts` — the house now lives
between turns), **B25/0036** (`socialInitiatives` + `diaryRoom` live tools), **B21/0018** (full lever manifest
+ drift guard), **B22/0033** (`playerTagline`), **B23/0034** (live-seam BDD), and front-end **C9/0033** (the
hero line now shows the engine's snarky tagline, fail-open) + the **0036 front-end API** (`/api/orwell/tagline`,
`/initiatives`, `/diary-room` + engine-client methods). Full engine gate green: **214 unit + 213 BDD**.

**The "continue all wiring" batch is done** (C10 = `orwellSocial.js`, merged). Since then the other agents
shipped **0037 — the interactive finale / jury-vote choreography** (engine built & BDD-green: appeal scorer +
staged statements → questions → vote reveal, through the 0034 seam) plus game-UI fixes (draggable HUDs, theme
picker). Engine gate green: **230 unit + 222 BDD**.

**Remaining — ALL implementer-ready (each carries a §8 "Definition of Ready": exact touch points, build
order/deps, test targets, no open decisions):**
- **0038** live off-screen society — **B27a done**; the **live soul-deepening half is now wired by 0041**
  (the off-screen tick `recordToSoul`s each scene); **B27b** (gossip↔checkpoint reconciliation) still ready (0038 §8).
- **0040** NPC confessionals — **done**; soul-recall feedback is now **live** (0041 put the `SoulStore` in the sandbox).
- **0041** character evolution/arc — **✅ DONE (B30, the LINCHPIN).** `SoulStore` is wired into the live
  `EngineCore`; the consequence fold + off-screen tick drive bounded, mean-reverting soul evolution that
  modulates the live competition modifier + a rattled-HOH nomination read; the arc persists + is recall-able;
  `CHARACTER` byte-stable; no number on any player surface. Unblocked the deferred soul halves of 0038 + 0040.
- **0039** promise/deal tracking — **done (B28)** · **0042** competition library (§8) → B31 · **0043** emergent bloc
  behavior (§8, honors ADR 0002) → B32 · **0044** strategic nom/vote refinements (§8) → B33.
- **0037 finale UI** — **B26** (Vault-free `finaleView` read) → **C11** (`orwellFinale.js`), per 0037 §8.
- **0022 — MVP-2 (the rich game UI)** — the one deferred feature (no DoR yet).
- **The audit batches below** — the **full product-audit batch (B34–B60 / C12–C18)** and the **front-end &
  experience batch (B61–B66 / C19–C28)**, both wave-ordered, governed by ADR 0003; audit specs
  **0045–0048 are drafted**, **0049** (B64) is drafted **and built**.

**Suggested build order for the implementer agents:** ~~0041 (linchpin)~~ **done** → 0039 (done) / 0043 → 0044
(consumes 0043 + 0041) → 0042 → B27b → 0037 UI — interleaved with the audit batches' waves (**Wave 0 hotfixes
B34–B36/C12 first**; B61/C19 are the highest-leverage experience pair). Each is independently buildable per its §8.
- *(By design, not a gap: the live engine narrator is `EchoNarrativePort`; the front-end narrates via
  `getMomentPrompt`. The `playerTagline` `setNarrator` seam is ready if engine-side narration is ever wired.)*

## Product ruling: the house does not exist when the player leaves (2026-06-10)

**Ruling.** The game clock runs only when the player is playing. When the player steps away — closes
the browser, ends the session — **the house ceases to exist**. No background scheming, no NPC social
ticks, no relationship drift, nothing. The lack of real estate is the core mechanic of Big Brother:
nobody leaves the house. Because the player *can* leave and NPCs cannot, any background activity that
accrues during player absence creates a structural playability asymmetry. The engine must not exploit
the player's absence against them.

**Implementation (done — `src/composition/runtime.ts`).** `DEFAULT_WATCHER.tickEveryMs` is now `0`
(pure turn-driven). The watcher is disabled by default. The house **only lives between the player's
own turns** via the existing `Orchestrator.maybeTurnDrivenTick` (one bounded off-screen tick per
player action, already built). If an operator wants real-time background life, they opt in via
`ORWELL_WATCHER_TICK_MS` — but it must never be the default.

**What "a player turn" means.** A player turn is any **state-mutating game action**: `advanceGame`,
`submitDecision`, `recordInteraction`, `makeDeal`, `diaryRoom`, `surfaceInformationTo`,
`createCharacter`. Read-only calls (`getGameState`, `gameStatus`, `playerTagline`, `getMomentPrompt`,
`socialInitiatives`, `runCompetition`) are not player turns — they don't mutate state and don't
trigger the off-screen tick. This is already encoded: only mutating ops call `onPersist()` →
`commitPlayerTurn()` → `touch()` → `maybeTurnDrivenTick()`.

## Full product-audit batch (B34–B60 / C12–C18) · 2026-06-09

Dispatch prompts for the **full product audit** (`docs/audits/2026-06-09-product-audit.md`). All gates were
green at audit time — every item below is *unasserted* behavior (a gap between the code and the game's own
mandates), not a failing test. **Read the audit's "Remediation principles (the preferred how)" section first** —
the seven patterns (single outcome authority · the pending-decision seam · validated references in / projections
out · folds in the commit path + constants modules · the orchestrator as the real spine · the versioned snapshot
as the contract · gates on the production path) are the architectural spine of these fixes; a fix that fights one
of them is probably wrong. **Lane note (current reality): OpenHands is not yet configured, so Claude Code owns
both lanes** — the engine items (`src/`, B-numbered) **and** the front-end items (`frontend/`, C-numbered). The
B/C split is kept as a **scope** marker (which tree the change lives in + the quarantine rules), not an agent
assignment; pick up C-items as readily as B-items. When a C-item touches `frontend/`, keep it quarantined from
the TS gate (`cd frontend && python3 -m pytest tests/`; never touch `cucumber.cjs`/`npm test`). House rules apply
(Vault Wall structural; `npm run test:arch` green; BDD/TDD-first; roles-only tests; keep gates green; PR per item).

**Feature-maker note:** four items need a `docs/features/NNNN-*.{md,feature}` spec **drafted first** before the
engine prompt can run — **0045** (B43), **0046** (B48), **0047** (B49), **0048** (B56). Draft them in the existing
spec style (design note + name-agnostic Gherkin) before dispatching those B-items.

> **"previously on…" recap** is B62's `re-entry` moment (the store recalled through the narrator — the ADR-0003

## Front-end & experience batch (B61–B63 / C19–C27) · 2026-06-09

Dispatch prompts for the **front-end & experience audit** (`docs/audits/2026-06-09-frontend-experience-audit.md`).
**Read `docs/decisions/0003-conversation-is-the-game.md` first — it governs the SHAPE of every item here.**
The beta proved the loop: a good LLM + the Bible + secrets *is* the game; the engine exists only to fix four
degradations (leaks / sycophancy / memory-thinning / sameness) and otherwise **get out of the model's way**. So
these prompts are deliberately written *light*: **prefer removing context to adding it; hand the model facts to
voice, never scripts to recite; UI is for guardrails (confirm-on-binding) and memory (the wall), not for replacing
talk.** If a fix here would add framing the model doesn't need, script what it should improvise, or move play out
of conversation into a dashboard — it's the wrong shape (ADR 0003's litmus test). Same lanes/house rules as the
audit batch above; OpenHands isn't configured, so Claude Code owns both (B/C is a scope marker).

**Amendments to the audit batch (C12–C18) — pick these up when you build those items:**
- **C12** ← also handle the **mid-scene tool-error** path (N5): an outcome-tool error must yield a "feed glitched,
  try again" beat, never a narrated winner — i.e. the game preamble (C19) must *not* carry the generic "a failed
  tool is not a stopping condition — improvise" rule. Resume-specific severity: the longer the transcript, the more
  convincing a fake continuation (F2).
- **C13** ← the prompt also advertises a **second, non-existent** comp lever `resolveCompetition` (N4) — collapse the
  manifest to one comp lever (pairs with B37/B61); the unrecorded in-chat Diary Room (U8) needs the same "the house
  never hears this" banner as the modal, or unify on one DR affordance.
- **C14** ← **substitute, don't restyle** (N3): on `game_active` turns, assemble a minimal game preamble *instead of*
  `_AGENT_PREAMBLE`/`_AGENT_RULES`, not in addition to them. Also strip `npc:`/`phase:`/`pick:` from tool results
  before they reach the model (N6). (Now scoped as **C19**.)
- **C15** ← exact dropped-vertical strings + happy-path/paint-order flash (J8/R1), game-frame the setup copy (J9),
  factory-reset must also clear FE game sessions (J12). (Folded into **C23**.)
- **C16** ← split into the **confirm-on-binding guardrail** (C20, ADR-0003-light — *not* a decision-card builder) and
  **the memory wall** (C21, roster/jury/self-status/portraits); U1's full `pending` data is the source either way.
- **C18** ← add Page-Visibility gating + coalesce `/state`+`/initiatives` (P2); pin the `game-trim.css` link to the
  build flag (P4).

### Addendum (same-session feedback) — presence, lingering, NPC coherence & testability · B64–B66 / C28

ADR 0003 was refined in-session (principles 4, 7, 8 + the new Testability section): UI may
**augment** the chat intelligently but never **replace** a game-building interaction; **lingering is
play** (mill around rooms, learn who's present/adjacent, talk to anyone while NPCs keep playing
*their* game, and nothing force-marches the week); **people must make sense** (one place at a time,
knowledge-scoped speech, stable persona); and each principle must be **testable structurally** where
possible — that section is the contract these items must satisfy. Read ADR 0003 before any of them.

## Operations, security & test-integrity batch (B67–B72 / C29) · 2026-06-09 (round 3)

Dispatch prompts for the **operations/security/test-integrity audit**
(`docs/audits/2026-06-09-operations-security-tests-audit.md`). This batch is **cross-cutting** —
it touches `deploy/`, `frontend/`, `src/`, and the test suite — so the B/C split is again just a
**scope** marker (engine/infra vs. front-end Python), not an agent assignment; **Claude Code owns
all of it**. The through-line the audit found: *the front-end ↔ engine boundary is where the real
operational risk concentrates, and the green test gate gives false confidence on three of the four
mandates.* Two findings ship-broken **today** (the engine-token footgun B67; the live knowledge-drop
B68); three more re-point the mandate gates at the production loop (B69/B70). House rules apply
(Vault Wall structural; `npm run test:arch` green; BDD/TDD-first; roles-only tests; keep gates green;
PR per item).

> **Good news the audit confirmed (no work needed):** the front-end's **own** security posture is
> sound — the authenticated-user → engine-sandbox-key trust path **cannot be spoofed** (the key is
> server-derived from the session, never client input), dropped dangerous verticals are **truly
> unmounted server-side** (404 even for admins), and auth/sessions/multi-tenant isolation are
> well-built. No critical or major app-security bypass. The items below are operations, test-integrity,

### C33 — the snarky hero tagline is genuinely AI-generated (not the curated fallback)  ·  Claude Code (front-end + engine)  ·  **R-2 · MINOR · RULING 2026-06-09** — ✅ DONE (verified 2026-06-10: `test_c33_ai_tagline.py`)

> In `kevinhirsch/orwell`, make the player tagline (0033) **actually AI-generated** when a game is live,
> reserving curated/static text for the fail-open path only. Today it is **never** model-generated:
> `GameSessionAdapter.playerTagline()` (`src/adapters/engine/GameSessionAdapter.ts:232-256`) only calls
> a narrator if `this.narrator` is set, and **`setNarrator` is never called in the live composition**
> (`outwardRoot.ts` wires `EchoNarrativePort` and nothing wires the tagline narrator) — so every live
> tagline is the hardcoded `SNARKY_TAGLINES[standing]` curated line, and the front-end client
> (`orwell_engine.player_tagline`) just relays it. Per ADR 0003 (engine supplies Vault-free facts, the
> **front-end LLM voices**), generate the line where the real model lives:
> 1. **Front-end generates it** from the engine's Vault-free standing/state (`gameStatus` + the engine's
>    curated line as a seed/anchor) via the existing `llm_core`/`llm_call_async` path, with a tight
>    anti-sycophantic instruction (a weak standing must NOT flatter — keep 0033's calibration). One line,
>    bounded length; **cache per `(user, week, phase, standing)`** so it regenerates only when the moment
>    advances, not per page load (mirror the engine cache at `GameSessionAdapter.ts:102-103,234-236`).
> 2. **Fallback chain, in order:** FE LLM line → the engine's curated `SNARKY_TAGLINES[standing]`
>    (still Vault-free, state-aware) → the static **"The house is waiting."** (PR #136). Never blank,
>    never blocks the homepage (keep the fail-open contract + `test_orwell_social.py`).
> 3. **Pre-game** (no started game) keeps a themed default — generation only kicks in once there's state
>    to be snarky about.
> *(Alternative if engine-side generation is ever preferred: wire a real `NarrativePort` via the
> existing `setNarrator` seam in the live root — but the FE-LLM path is the ADR-0003-consistent choice
> and needs no new engine narrator.)*
> **Vault-free by construction:** the tagline is built only from the public standing projection — never
> hidden votes/targeting/souls/off-screen (extend the 0001 canary on `playerTagline` already covers the
> engine side; assert the FE prompt carries no Vault field). **DoD:** with a live game + LLM configured,
> the hero line varies and is model-written (not one of the fixed curated strings); with the LLM/engine
> down it falls through curated → "The house is waiting." without blocking; cached per moment; `pytest`

> **DONE** (spec `docs/features/0050-casting-interview.{md,feature}`; in `cucumber.cjs`). Character
> creation is now the game's first SCENE, not a form: pre-game, the chat is the producer's "get to
> know the cast" interview. Engine: the `character-creation` moment prompt is the full interview
> operating manual (producer persona, coverage list, the canonical archetype/style **manifest
> generated from `ARCHETYPES`** — drift-tested, ending protocol); `CreateCharacterReq` carries the
> distillation (`personaArchetype`/`personaStrategyStyle`, `backstory`, `motivation`,
> `privateStrategy`, `interviewNotes[]`); the deepeners seed `Character.background` + the player's
> `Soul.memory` (pre-game memories, snapshot-durable per 0030) and the player-only fields; the
> creation return carries the **casting card** (`characterType`, `strategyStyle`, per-aptitude
> **tier words** standout/solid/scrappy, story, motivation) — qualitative only, no number crosses
> (the persona sentinel test now proves the card carries words and the payload no floats).
> Front-end: `apply_game_framing` injects the interview moment **pre-game under the game build**
> (the missing seam — pre-game chat had no game framing at all); the `createCharacter` FE schema's
> archetype enum was DRIFTED (five stale labels) — replaced with the canonical 12 + the deepener
> params, with a C13-style drift test parsing `characterFactory.ts`; `orwellOnboarding.js` is now
> the interview **gate** ("the producers will see you now" → prefill the composer, never auto-send;
> quick-start name-only fallback kept as the no-model escape hatch, audit J4). 0015's invariants
> all hold (balanced bounds, OOC/no-witness, B36 no-wipe). 7 BDD scenarios + 12 unit + 8 pytest.
> **Evolving mechanic** — anticipated next steps in 0050 §9 (richer derived signals, NPC casting

### B73b — 0050 v2: incremental intake — the modal is GONE; the chat acquires everything  ·  Claude Code (engine + FE)  ·  **product ruling 2026-06-10 — ✅ DONE**

> **DONE.** Ruling: the authoring data must be "acquired through the actual chat with Orwell instead of
> being a modal popup", and "OOBE can be half done … the status of which determines what the next step
> is within the game engine." Engine: a new `updateCasting` player tool records answers AS THEY LAND
> (any subset; notes append) into a durable pre-game intake (`SessionCore.casting` — a half-done
> interview survives a restart, 0030); `castingStatusOf` (pure, `src/engine/castingIntake.ts`) computes
> { known, missing, next, ready } in the engine's ask-order — **the engine, not the model, owns the next
> step**; the pre-game `GameStateView`/moment prompt carry the live status ("already on file — do not
> re-ask"); `createCharacter` finalizes FROM the intake (`playerName` now optional; rejected if no name
> anywhere); the casting tools (`createCharacter`/`updateCasting`/`getMomentPrompt`) may mint a fresh
> user's sandbox (HttpMcpServer allowlist). Front-end: `apply_game_framing` fetches the interview moment
> pre-game (fallback: a producer-voiced static steer); the C23 authoring form is **deleted** —
> `orwellOnboarding.js` keeps only the J4 model-gate + F5 dark-house holding cards and the seat hand-off
> (fresh chat session per interview = the F7 fence, then prefill "I take my seat for the casting
> interview." — never auto-send); `updateCasting` wired through schemas/agent allowlists/executor with

> Wave order: D1→D4 are CRITICAL (D1 first — it unblocks re-measuring D4); D5–D10 MAJOR; D11 MINOR.

### D1 — one sanctioned season-restart door (the headline)  ·  CRIT  ·  engine + FE route

> The FE's `/api/orwell/new-game` restarts via player-channel `createCharacter+confirmRestart`;
> the orchestrator's non-degradation baseline correctly reads the fresh season as catastrophic
> loss ⇒ every post-restart player-turn commit faults and is never persisted; on engine restart
> the finished season resurrects (verified live: after ~60 restarts the durable save still held
> season 1). Route the FE reset through the admin reset delegate (`registry.resetUser`, where
> `registry.ts:190` says B36/C12 belong) — or make `confirmRestart` reset the orchestrator
> baseline + saves identically; a fault on the restart commit must fail the request (4xx), never
> 200-then-rollback. **Add the missing test: play season 1 → FE-style restart → season 2's first
> save survives an engine restart.** Also fixes the `recordInteraction` 500s and the new-game
> state races observed on the faulted sandbox.

### D2 — floating-panel placement: nothing may cover the composer or another panel's controls  ·  CRIT  ·  FE

> At 390×844 the presence strip floats over the composer (play impossible on a phone); post-season
> the retrospective panel does the same at mobile AND tablet; the status HUD covers the social
> HUD's Diary button at ALL viewports (the DR modal cannot be opened by pointer anywhere). Also
> fix the `.hidden modal-minimized` state that still intercepts pointer events. Add the harness's
> overlap/interception checks to `browser_smoke.py`.

### D3 — decision card survives reload  ·  CRIT  ·  FE

> `orwellDecision.js` mounts only on the live agent-turn `orwell:pending` event; reloading
> mid-decision leaves no card and no signal a decision is owed. On boot, read the pending from
> `/api/orwell/state` and dispatch the same event.

### D4 — player-survival calibration (the player has never reached the jury)  ·  CRIT  ·  engine

> 62/62 seeded seasons end with the player out pre-jury (passive driver; self-saving veto answers
> included; the one fault-free season matches). Move-in priors + threat-primary noms + ever-
> deepening NPC↔NPC bonds make the player the standing consensus target. Investigate, calibrate,
> and add a property gate (passive player reaches jury in ≥X% of seeds); re-measure the social
> (recordInteraction-folding) path after D1.

### D5 — diegetic labels for updateCasting/whereabouts/seasonRecap/seasonRetrospective/npcVoice  ·  MAJOR  ·  FE + test

> The five tools render raw camelCase names in the transcript (`_orwellToolBeats` gaps); extend
> the C13 drift test to require a display label (or INFRA exemption) per lever.

### D6 — game build must not load KaTeX/Mermaid from a CDN  ·  MAJOR  ·  FE
### D7 — in-game holding copy game-framed; hide the Agent/Chat toggle on game turns  ·  MAJOR  ·  FE
### D8 — entropy default seed (same name must not replay the identical season; explicit seeds stay for tests)  ·  MAJOR  ·  engine
### D9 — portraits on roster/status/decision surfaces (C21/V2 as stated)  ·  MAJOR  ·  FE
### D10 — malformed tool args ⇒ 400 refusal, never 500 (schema-validate at the HTTP boundary)  ·  MAJOR  ·  engine
### D11 — HUD chrome tap-target floor (–/× buttons); state cache-bust on new-game  ·  MINOR  ·  FE

> reset + E69 ordinals folded in) · E88 Diary Room → standing sidebar button + composer DR mode
> (capture-phase send interception; the floating dialog is gone; social keeps only approaches) ·
> E95 minimize dock → sidebar "Windows" rows (chatbox chip strip dead; the .modal-minimized

> one-door work by design.
### U4 — transcript surface + trims + 0052 themes  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #208)**

> E65 the gamechanged dispatcher + restart-opens-a-fresh-session · E93 the played record (game
> transcripts keep only copy/fork — no edit/delete/regenerate/rewrites) · D3/E66 pending survives
> reload (per-user FE cache at the three AdvanceView chokepoints, served on /status, card re-arms
> on boot/gamechanged) · D5/W6 diegetic beat labels for the ENTIRE keep-set incl. ui_control, with
> the drift test iterating GAME_TOOL_KEEP · E72 model picker admin-only under the game build ·
> E96 Save-to-Documents removed · D7 game-framed empty-state copy + the Agent|Chat toggle hidden
> on game turns · D6/W8 zero third-party CDN under the game build (KaTeX/Mermaid stripped at

## Audit parallel-phase lanes (round 5/6 + addenda) · 2026-06-10

### Lane 6 — FE framing & turn integrity (Python) + the E89 engine gate  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #214)**

> The agent-tools opt-in gates: **A1** the escalation-reason split (`auto_escalation_withhold` —
> the game escalation subtracts sanctioned opt-ins; the intent escalation keeps the full
> withhold; builtin_browser always withheld; the vacuous isolation test replaced by COMPOSITION
> tests assembling the disabled set exactly as the route does) · **A2** gate 3 (opted-in
> optionals join the schema candidate set at the pinned merge — proven by the non-vacuous
> schema-assembly test: game turn + `game_tools_enabled=["chat_with_model"]` ⇒ the schema array
> handed to the API call contains it) + gate 4 (admin-only UI copy + the app_api 404-by-design
> note) · **P2** the re-entry moment requested on the first game turn of a (re)opened session
> (THE RECORD on a fresh context; the casting session's premiere is NOT a re-entry) · **P3**
> substitution keys on `ctx.framed` (a framed casting turn gets `CASTING_AGENT_PREAMBLE`, never
> the producer-persona-on-generic-rulebook stack) · **P7/E24** incognito inert under the game
> build (route force-off + framing-level belt) · **P8** single datetime + the slim prompt-safety
> line on framed game-build turns · **E16** preset personas never ride the GM stack · **E22**
> the narrated-but-never-recorded guard in CODE (`ensure_turn_recorded`: bounded digest fallback
> + process counter; sanctioned explicitly in the B66 registry) · **E23** no blind retries of

> `firstCeremonyBeatResolved`, seed-spanning test). Gates: FE pytest 372 green · boot/browser
> smokes green · responsive matrix 37/0/0 · `npm test` green for the engine sliver.

### U5 — game-build trim remainder (Lane 8: W1+W5 · W3 · W4 · W7 · E17)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #211)**

> The Stream-W half U4 didn't carry. W1 `ui_control` collapses to the curated safe subset under
> the game build — highlight/clear_highlight + set_theme/create_theme — enforced in code at
> `do_ui_control` (mode/model/incognito-toggle/panel/email actions refused, game-framed) with a
> `chatStream.js` data-game-build belt · W5 the ui_control manifest is game-only on BOTH paths
> (the prompt section via a structural builtin-override injection on the settings read path —
> `GAME_UI_CONTROL_SECTION`, never persisted, wins over user overrides — and the native function
> schema via `game_ui_control_schema`: enum = safe subset, email args gone; `highlight` now
> converts with its selector) · W3 the Bitwarden vault vertical joins `GAME_DROP_SET` +
> `mount_optional` (404 server-side under the build, back off-build; boot-smoke proven live both
> ways) · W4 the slash surface is the keep-set only (`GAME_SLASH_KEEP` + a dispatch-time gate
> covering legacy aliases, with a game-framed refusal; /help, fuzzy suggestions, and the
> autocomplete menu all filter through one `isGameSlashAllowed` seam) · W7 `/backgrounds`
> removed outright (its static page was never vendored — the route only 500'd) · E17
> `search_chats` KEEP → OPTIONAL (off by default; opt-in via Settings → Tools; membership lines
> only — the gate logic is Lane 6's). Proving suite `frontend/tests/test_lane7_game_trim.py`
> (25 tests); pytest 357 · boot/browser smokes · responsive matrix all green; the W6 keep-set
> beat-label drift test stays green after the shrink.

### L8 — ops & private-repo (A4/ruling #17+E84 · E80 · E83 · E85 · E8 · E32)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #218)**

> **A4/ruling #17 (closes E84):** the single-PAT private-repo design — `GIT_TOKEN` lives in
> `data/.env`, a git credential helper supplies it to every fetch/pull, and the host
> update/factory-reset bridges become LOCAL-COPY (execute the already-checked-out in-container
> copy after a pinned-ref `git fetch`; zero raw-curl of branch tips); the installer tolerates a
> checkout missing its origin remote. **E80:** `deploy/smoke.sh` refutes are behavioral (sentinel
> save + the full stat/edge refute list + the credential-helper gate), not textual greps.
> **E83:** the frontend Python deps ride a pip-compile lockfile (Python 3.11/Debian 12 target),
> pinned on every update. **E85:** systemd units harden fully (`CapabilityBoundingSet`,
> `RestrictAddressFamilies`, `SystemCallFilter=@system-service`, `ProtectKernel*`,
> `RestrictSUIDSGID`, `LockPersonality`, `UMask=0077`) and `orwell-frontend.service` carries a
> default `ORWELL_PORT`. **E8:** `FileSaveStore` fsyncs file + dir before rename (power-loss
> durability). **E32:** user-id capped at the HTTP edge (400) + constant-time token compare in
> `HttpMcpServer`. Verified by `tests/unit/opsPrivateRepo.test.ts`, `saveDurability.test.ts`,
> `httpEdgeAuth.test.ts`, and the upgraded smoke refutes.

### L11 — docs & specs (E86(b) · E87 · specs 0051/0053)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #219)**

> **E86 — the amend path** (the audit's lane split: building the fastembed adapter is its own
> engine lane, E86(a) — still open): ADR 0004 → "Accepted — **adapter not yet built**" with an
> honest Implementation-status section (production composes `DeterministicEmbedding`; no
> `fastembed` in `package.json`; the FE's *Python* fastembed is the vendored RAG stack, not the
> engine's `EmbeddingProvider`) and the concrete path to done (exact lib+model pin, lazy ONNX
> load, deterministic fallback, deploy-time model fetch). CLAUDE.md / README /
> `bb-sim-spec.md` §16 / `CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` §15 / the decisions index stop
> overclaiming — the adapter joins the long-acknowledged deferrals. No fake pin shipped.
> **E87 — the hygiene sweep, all of (a)–(i)** (+ T18's fast-check-is-selective note):
> 0033/0036's unit-gated deviation recorded in their spec headers + README rows; 0029's
> honest pytest header; CLAUDE.md regroups 0035 as BDD-gated and mentions 0029; this queue's
> "Still on the feature-maker" + "Reconciliation still owed" blocks stamped
> HISTORICAL/RESOLVED; the README 0010 row carries its host-validation deferral; the B70
> coverage-floor deviation (90/88/82) recorded; every shipped `.feature` sheds its "# DRAFT"
> header (only 0022 — deferred — and the new specced-not-built files keep one); the
> not-yet-MCP/JSON-RPC caveat parenthesized; `cucumber.cjs` 0048/0049 order/indent cosmetics
> (**no path added or removed**). **Specs (spec only — NOT built, in no gate):** **0051
> in-character images** (Vault-free prompt builder over the visible projection, knowledge-scoped
> depiction, no unresolved-outcome stills, recorded image beats, per-season style anchor,
> budgets, graceful absence — ADR 0003-bound) and **0053 admin transcripts** (ruling #14
> verbatim: admin-gated API + one quiet Settings row, read-only, tool-call nodes first-class,
> DR inclusion disclosed, survives game reset / dies with factory reset; FE pytest lane when
> built — never `cucumber.cjs`; no God-Mode/Vault escalation). Both indexed
> "Specced — not built" in `docs/features/README.md`. Gates: full `npm test` green post-merge
> (612 unit/property/arch · 318 BDD scenarios).

### L9 — calibration (D4/E33 re-measurement · the jury-reach gate · finale calibration)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #220)**

> Re-measured on the merged spine: 19/20 passive seasons reach jury/endgame (was 0/62 in round 4)
> — emergent NPC self-interest (floaters coast, goats get dragged), **ruled realistic 2026-06-11**;
> the anti-sycophancy teeth move to the FINALE. The jury was crowning the goat (7/10 passive F2
> wins): fixed by `bondKeepWeight` in `voteChoice` (voters protect the nominee THEY are bonded to),
> dropping `−0.5·threat` from `juryLean` (finale threat-aversion structurally rewarded the goat),
> and `JURY_WEIGHTS.gameRespect × gameRespectTerm` over a new persisted public-facts resume tally
> (HOH + veto wins) — a betrayal manner still outweighs the max respect split (bitter juries stay
> real). Passive finale wins 7/10 → 3/10, each EARNED (≥2 broadcast comp wins). The permanent gate:
> `tests/property/juryReach.property.test.ts` (floor ≥3/20 · ceiling ≤19/20 · ≥1 pre-jury loss ·
> wins rare AND comp-earned; seeded-deterministic, roles only).

### L10 — hardening sweep (E18/E77 · E19 · E27/E28/E30/E31 · C4/C5 · E78 · T8/T9/T12/T15–T17)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #221)**

> **The structural wall hardens:** dep-cruiser goes **default-deny** (E18) and EVERY forbidden
> rule is unit-asserted (E77 — `test:arch` is no longer the only place they run). **The live
> sentinel deepens** (E19): knowledge-bearing reads swept per beat + one full post-finish sweep.
> **The HTTP edge:** two-tier token auth — an admin secret is its own credential, player ⊉ admin
> (E27, unified with #218's constant-time helper); tool LISTING never mints a sandbox (E28); a
> dead-socket answer can't crash the process (E30); malformed args are field-naming 400s, never
> 500s (E31 — the 0009 sentinel sweeps treat the typed refusal as an outcome and sweep ITS text).
> **Integrity math:** any single degradation trips the checkpoint (C4); competition input guards
> (C5); the no-secrets guard scans the whole tree (E78). **Test integrity:** T8/T9/T12/T15–T17
> step-definition hardening + the 0004/0009/0036/0037/0047 feature amendments.
> **Open remainder (not reached — two lane agents died mid-work):** T3–T7, T10, T11, T19, T20.
> *(All cleared — see Lane A, Lane B, and Lane C below.)*

### Lane A — cross-lane tails (E54 · E58 · C8 · E60/E89 · ruling #1)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #224)**

> The follow-up tails the parallel lanes left on the table, each with its proving test:
> **E54** — the `reliability` evidence signal (built in #216) is now CONSUMED: `chooseVetoSave`
> ranks a veto save by demonstrated loyalty (proven protector outranks an equally-liked stranger),
> and a centered reliability term weighted by `JURY_WEIGHTS.reliability` shifts the juror's lean.
> **E58** — the in-game DAY index (`dayOfWeek(phase)`, hoh=1…eviction=5, null off-ladder) is
> surfaced on `PublicGameStatus.day`. **C8** — casting intake's third sub-item: a later
> `updateCasting` that replaces a captured scalar reports `overwrote: [...]` so the producer
> confirms rather than silently clobbering (caps + echo neutralization unchanged from #213).
> **E60/E89 (FE)** — the approach chip varies its framing by the `bond | probe` motive enum (copy +
> class + tooltip), and a dedicated FE belt (`firstCeremonyResolved`) suppresses every chip before
> the first ceremony resolves — holding even if the engine fails open (browser-smoke proven).
> **Ruling #1 (doc-only)** — the CLAUDE.md "no fixed cast" do-not formulation. Engine `npm test`
> green (664 unit + 318 BDD); FE pytest + browser smoke + responsive matrix green.

### Lane B — T-remainder test repairs (T3–T7 · T10 · T11 · T19 · T20)  ·  **✅ DONE (PR #225)**

> The remaining open Stream-T findings (the L10 remainder). TESTS ONLY. Each strengthened test
> **mutation-verified** (break the production behavior → red → revert).
> **Live re-points:** T5 (narration never changes an outcome) and T6 (narrator cannot advance the
> game) move off pure-function / hand-built-constant fixtures onto LIVE `GameSessionAdapter`
> seasons (live competition + hallucinating narrator; live nomination beat — phase & pending
> unmoved). T7 (agent can't fabricate an outcome) moves onto the B55 live seam WITH a relationship
> model, so recording the engine's result FOLDS a real hidden consequence (the fold the old
> fixture made impossible) — the winner is a real roster member that re-runs identical.
> **Real assertions:** T3 (offscreen recall) returns the specific recorded note; T4
> (CHARACTER-unchanged) asserts a real generated houseguest's static `Character` is byte-stable
> across a season of soul-deepening.
> **T11:** the per-wake cap asserts the TICK COUNT via an `advance` spy (the ×10 event-bound fudge
> is gone); the isolation Thens plant unique per-user sentinels and assert genuine
> content/knowledge cross-absence (record + knowledge + player surface); the vacuous
> `assert.ok(true)` watcher-stop step asserts no-dangling-timer + idempotent stop.
> **T10/T19 [FE/arch]:** already hardened in code by PR #221 — T10's decorative `readsVault` assert
> carries a dep-cruiser pointer + a live-allowlist behavioral assert; T19's FE decision-kind list
> is parsed live from `src/ports/GameSession.ts` (the c13 cross-language manifest parser). Verified
> + stamped.
> **T20 [FE]:** `scripts/browser_smoke.py` gains a real social-HUD minimize-to-dock behavior check;
> `tests/test_orwell_huds.py` source-greps are explicitly re-labeled as SOURCE-PINS
> (`test_sourcepin_*`) pointing at that behavior coverage.
> **Gates:** engine `npm test` GREEN (typecheck → build → 659 unit/UAT → 318 BDD); FE
> `test_orwell_huds.py` green + both touched FE files compile (full FE pytest/browser/matrix gate
> runs in CI). Per-item stamps live on the audit doc's finding lines.

### Lane C — feature 0053 (admin transcripts, ruling #14) · front-end (Python) · **✅ DONE (PR #223)**

> Built the L11-specced 0053 surface. **API** (`frontend/routes/admin_transcript_routes.py`,
> registered in `app.py` after admin-wipe, both behind `require_admin`): `GET /api/admin/transcripts`
> lists sessions across ALL users (id, owner, title, created/updated, message count, game-session
> marker) with `?user=`/`?since=` filters + `?limit=`/`?offset=` pagination; `GET
> /api/admin/transcripts/{id}?format=json|md` exports the full transcript — message roles +
> timestamps AND the agent-thread tool-call nodes (names, args, outputs) verbatim, the debug value.
> **UI:** one admin-only "Transcripts" `admin-card` in the System panel (`static/index.html`) driven
> by `initTranscripts()` (`static/js/admin.js`) — owner filter + per-session JSON/MD download; no
> nav surface; hidden for non-admins by the `.admin-only` rule. **Boundaries:** read-only (no
> POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE); the copy carries the Diary-Room-inclusion caveat; transcripts live in the
> FE chat store so they survive the game reset and die with the factory reset by construction (no
> script change). **Gate:** `frontend/tests/test_0053_admin_transcripts.py` (12 cases) — green; the
> rest of the FE pytest suite unaffected (425 passing; the 2 reds are pre-existing env-only
> module gaps: `rag_vector`). FE pytest lane only — never `cucumber.cjs`; no engine change.

### Lane D — deploy: privileged UI port (80) + container console password · ops · **✅ DONE**

> Two operator-reported install defects (2026-06-11), fixed at the deploy seam with the audited
> E85 posture intact.
> **Privileged UI port (<1024, e.g. 80):** the hardened `orwell-frontend.service` runs uvicorn as
> the non-root `orwell` user with an EMPTY `CapabilityBoundingSet=` — it structurally cannot bind
> a port below 1024, so `ORWELL_PORT=80` crash-looped into "connection refused".
> `orwell-install.sh` AND `orwell-update.sh` now reconcile a systemd drop-in
> (`orwell-frontend.service.d/10-privileged-port.conf`) granting exactly `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`,
> written only when the configured port is <1024 and removed otherwise — the base unit stays
> byte-stable (the E85 pin holds) and running the updater repairs pre-fix installs (it reads the
> LIVE port from `data/.env`).
> **Console password:** `orwell.sh` created the LXC with no root password, so the Proxmox console
> rejected every login. New optional `CT_ROOT_PASSWORD` (whiptail passwordbox in the advanced
> flow + env for non-interactive; ≥5 chars), applied via `chpasswd` on STDIN — never on a pct
> command line (the GIT_TOKEN no-secrets-in-argv rule) — and the installer's final message now
> states the console-access path either way (`pct enter` always works).
> **Gate:** `tests/unit/opsPrivateRepo.test.ts` gains two suites (drop-in present+gated+removable
> in both scripts; update reads the live env; the base unit keeps `^CapabilityBoundingSet=$`;
> password is stdin-only with no `pct … --password`) — the <1024 gate mutation-verified; full
> `npm test` green (675 unit/property/arch → 318 BDD).

### Lane E — install-script audit & hardening (post-incident) · ops · **✅ DONE**

> A real install died silently between the engine build and service registration: the box
> answered "connection refused", the updater later failed with "Unit … not found", and the
> script's success banner was reachable by simply falling off the end. The audit (F1–F8) and
> refactor of `deploy/orwell-install.sh`:
> **Observability:** ERR trap + per-step tracking (`set -E` so it fires inside functions) names
> the failed step/line/exit and says a plain re-run resumes (idempotent); every run appends to
> `data/install.log`; the success banner is EARNED by `verify_install` — both units active AND
> the engine `/health` + FE `/openapi.json` probes answering (smoke.sh's own contracts), with
> status/journal tails on failure.
> **Bugs:** `git safe.directory` (the orwell-owned checkout vs root-git updates — git ≥2.35
> "dubious ownership" would have killed every update; latent because the 0010 real-host smoke
> never ran) · `chown` covers an out-of-tree `DATA_DIR` · the privileged-port drop-in keys on
> the EFFECTIVE port from `data/.env` (no env-arg drift on re-runs) · root guard + port
> validation up front · re-runs `systemctl restart` (no stale processes after a rebuild) · the
> final message prints the container's real IP, never `http://0.0.0.0`.
> Structured into named phase functions + `main()`; every decision comment
> (A4/E27/E32/E83/E84/E85/B67/B72/ADR-0004) preserved in place.
> **Gate:** `opsPrivateRepo.test.ts` "post-incident hardening" suite (9 tests; the verify-call
> and <1024 gates mutation-verified); `bash -n` clean; typecheck/build/684 unit/318 BDD green.
> *(Noted, not this lane: `npm run test:arch` (the depcruise CLI, outside the `npm test` gate)
> reports 3 pre-existing violations from the E86a wiring — `src/main.ts → engineRoot /
> FastembedEmbedding`; needs its own ruling/queue item.)*

## Lane F — the DWE windowing mission (audit → one window kit) · 2026-06-11

> Source: `docs/audits/2026-06-11-dwe-window-audit.md` (the surface × norm matrix is the
> spec; findings F1–F11 + the duplication census are the work). Bar: ruling #16. Order:
> ruling #15 (UI track outranks non-CRIT) — and within the lane, fresh-install blockers
> first. House rules: FE-only (never `cucumber.cjs`/`npm test`); ADR 0003 — windows AUGMENT
> the chat, no game interaction moves out of it; each wave DELETES its bespoke code in the
> same PR and flips its matrix cells from ❌ to hard gate assertions (browser_smoke /
> responsive_matrix); roles only in tests.

### F-0 — Phase 1: the audit · **✅ DONE (this PR)**

> 75 live Playwright assertions across virgin/casting/mid-game/finale-staged/engine-down ×
> both builds × the viewport matrix; 16 fails → findings F1–F11; #233's no-trap contract
> verified as the norm-(g) baseline and extended (3× cycles, the real J4 card). Matrix doc +
> failure screenshots in `docs/audits/`.

### F-1 — the window kit (`OrwellWindow` + `.ow-*`) · CRIT-first · **✅ DONE**

> Build the kit on the S-stream mechanism and fix the two structural breaks INSIDE it:
> **F1** (the invisible `#minimized-dock` — minimize currently loses the window; visibility
> driven by a class with real-pointer restore, T20 upgraded from evaluate-clicks to trusted
> clicks) and **F2** (slot-restack vs windowDrag fight — drag is dead on every slot panel;
> restack pauses during drag or drag mutates the slot offset). Kit owns: registration
> (modalManager + escMenuStack), drag+explicit clamp, resize, ONE z-authority +
> click-to-front + focused state (F9), minimize-to-dock with the ruling-#19 fly-out + E97
> reduced-motion (F4), one geometry-persistence scheme clamped per user+game (F5 deletes
> `orwell-finale-pos`), focus-return on close (F8), keyboard move (F10), teardown. The A3
> layout kit composes window BODIES. Gate: the kit's own browser-smoke block + the matrix.
> **DONE:** `orwellWindow.js` (the kit: chrome cluster ≥24px named targets · click-to-front +
> `ow-focused` + the 500–980 window band · ruling-#19 fly-out/fly-away with reduced-motion
> strip · slot-offset persistence with explicit clamp · focus-return · arrows/Home keyboard
> move · AbortController teardown · the `OrwellWindowKit` seam) + the `.ow-*` family;
> **F1 fixed** (class-driven `#minimized-dock.ow-has-rows`, the inline-'' reveal gone; dock
> FLIP respects reduced motion); **F2 fixed** (`orwellSlots` stands down while
> `modal-dragging`, reentrancy-guarded; offsets now record real deltas); **F5's persistence
> half folded in** (finale on the slot system, POS_KEY deleted + stale keys cleared,
> `mobileSkip:0` gone — its chrome migrates in its F-2 wave); Escape spliced into ui.js's
> single arbiter (menus → kit windows → modals, F7). Gates: browser_smoke gains the F1/F2
> hard assertions (trusted clicks — the evaluate-click blindness is gone) + a real
> kit-window end-to-end block; `test_f_window_kit.py` source-pins; FE pytest 445 green;
> matrix 37/0/0.

### F-2 — migration waves (each: behavior-identical-or-better, bespoke code deleted) · **✅ COMPLETE (waves 1–3)**

> Wave order: status HUD (stays sidebar chrome — composes title/controls only) → social +
> approaches (F2/F3/F6/F7 cells flip; the narrow tier gets ONE sheet host so two sheets can
> never overlap — F3) → Diary Room (button+pill stay; verify-only) → finale (F5 dual
> persistence deleted) → retrospective + presence + banner (cluster consistency, F6) →
> settings + theme (F8 focus-return; cluster already injected) → remaining modals/popovers
> (W13–W16; styledConfirm/Prompt traps fold into the kit's stack; decision card gains
> non-binding Escape, F11).
> **WAVE 1 DONE:** the SOCIAL panel composes the kit — bespoke chrome/drag/dock wiring
> deleted (`osoc-hdr`/`osoc-min`/`modalManager.register`/`makeWindowDraggable` all gone from
> `orwellSocial.js`); its Escape/focus/fly-out/persistence now come from `OrwellWindow`, and
> the C26 auto-park routes through the kit. **F3 fixed structurally:** the slot engine's
> narrow tier is a SHEET HOST (`restackNarrowSheets` — one stacked column across both top
> slots, measured heights) and the per-panel `top:44px !important` pins are deleted from
> social AND finale; two visible sheets stack, never overlap (browser-smoke-asserted at
> 390×844 via the new `_orwellFinaleEnsure` seam). A kit restore bug caught by the gate
> (display:'' falling through to a consumer's CSS `display:none` — the F1 class one layer up)
> fixed by capture/restore of the pre-minimize inline display. STATUS HUD: verify-only —

> T20 pins amended to the kit composition (`test_orwell_huds.py`). Gates: FE pytest 464 ·
> browser smoke (kit + F1/F2/F3 hard assertions) · boot smoke · matrix 37/0/0 — all green.
> **WAVE 2 DONE:** the FINALE composes the kit — bespoke titlebar/minimize/dock/drag wiring
> deleted from `orwellFinale.js` (`ofin-hdr`/`ofin-min`/`modalManager.register`/
> `makeWindowDraggable` gone; `POS_KEY` fully retired); same ambient-HUD capability profile as
> social (minimizable, no close); the F3 sheet host + `_orwellFinaleEnsure` seam from wave 1
> keep gating it at 390×844. **Diary Room: verify-only** — ruling #4 composer mode, not a
> window; its audit cells were all green and the E88 pins stand (`test_orwell_huds.py`,
> `test_ui_elements.py`); no change.
> **WAVE 3 DONE (closes F-2):** the F6 tail — presence/retro/banner dismiss buttons adopt the
> shared `.ow-dismiss` affordance (kit CSS, injected at load; ≥24px, hover/focus-visible) —
> these stay NON-windows per rulings #3-class chrome. **F8 fixed for the WHOLE `.modal`
> family** from ui.js's one visibility observer: opener stashed on hidden→visible, focus
> restored on visible→hidden, never yanked if the user moved it. **F11 fixed**: Escape in the
> decision card = the × path (dismiss only, never submit), via the new
> `data-ow-escape-scope` contract — any in-flow surface can claim focused-context-first
> Escape and the global arbiter stands down. **Arbiter ordering corrected** (caught live by
> the smoke): menus → escape-scoped surfaces → MODALS → kit windows — a visible modal
> outranks every non-modal window, so Escape can no longer park a background panel while
> settings is open. **W13/W14 disposition:** styled dialogs + escMenuStack stay as-is (their
> audit cells were green; the keep-list keeps them; the F-3 ratchet grandfathers their

### F-3 — the ratchet · **✅ DONE — LANE F COMPLETE**

> A source-grep + runtime gate: any element matching the window selector must be
> kit-managed — no JS outside the kit registers drag/persist/minimize handlers on a
> window-like surface (the census §4 signatures are the grep corpus); new windows MUST
> compose the kit. Matrix cells that passed stay green; each wave wires its flipped cells
> into `browser_smoke.py` / `responsive_matrix.py` as hard assertions.
> **DONE:** `frontend/tests/test_f3_window_ratchet.py` — the census signatures as the grep
> corpus (drag-engine callers frozen to the kit + {planWindow, settings, theme, workspace};
> slot registration = kit + the two ruling-class strips; dock registration = kit only; no new
> geometry-persistence keys beyond the pinned marker set; no new per-surface Escape handlers
> beyond the surveyed frozen list — shrink-only) + the runtime half in `browser_smoke.py`
> (every floating game panel carries `[data-ow-window]`; the bespoke 'Drag to move' marker is
> extinct outside the kit; the kit seam answers). Audit findings stamped on the doc.
> **Post-Lane-F pointers:** `orwellCast.js` (0051, landed mid-campaign — own Escape handler,
> grandfathered with a pointer) is the first kit-migration candidate; the W15 build=0 family
> migration merges the legacy z counters (F9's tail) when it happens.

## Lane G — playtest response (2026-06-11, live session feedback) · PARALLEL DISPATCH

> Source: live playtest feedback (nine reports, one session). Ruling #15 ordering inside the
> lane: observability/blockers first. **Dispatch: G1/G2/G3/G5/G6/G8 run as PARALLEL agents in
> isolated worktrees, one PR each; agents do NOT edit this file** (the foreman stamps statuses
> at close-out). G4 follows G3+G6 (shared CSS regions); G7 awaits the product verdict.

### G1 — Health & Logs (admin Settings card, UI-based) + image-gen observability · **OPEN**
> Robust health checking and logging, visible in the admin side of Settings, UI-based (user
> commission). The card shows: both tiers' health + agreement (the A12 checklist in the UI);
> embeddings provider + its degrade flag; image-generation provider state
> (configured/absent/failing — answers the 0051 placeholder mystery on-screen); a persistent
> capped failure ring (timestamp · tool · sanitized error class · duration — no payloads,
> Vault-safe); slow-call timings; a "Download debug bundle" button (failures + health snapshot
> + config-sans-secrets). Engine: /health grows a capped recent-failures list + per-call
> timings (generalizing lastError; Vault-free operational metadata only).

### G2 — every launcher restores its minimized window · **OPEN**
> Clicking a window's launcher while it is minimized RESTORES it (user report: the settings
> gear no-ops — `user-bar-settings` is not a registered restore trigger). Fix
> launcher-agnostically in the open path (restore-if-minimized in modalManager), so EVERY
> window behaves identically.

### G3 — sidebar coherence: the .list-item padding standard + no dead affordances · **OPEN**
> THE STANDARD (user ruling): New Chat / Search (.list-item, uniform 8px) are the correct
> buttons — every sidebar button (incl. the 6px user-bar cluster) normalizes to equal padding,
> smoke-asserted (equal computed padding across visible sidebar buttons). Dead affordance:
> under the game build the Tools section is a 10px collapse chevron guarding a lone Theme
> entry — when a section has ≤1 visible child, drop the chevron and render the entry as a
> plain row. Every visible button must visibly act.

### G4 — one visual language across all windows · **OPEN (wave 2 — after G3+G6)**
> Settings/legacy modals vs kit windows look different (user report). Extract shared visual
> tokens (bg, border, radius, shadow, titlebar type) consumed by BOTH families.

### G5 — the refresh-persistence audit · **OPEN**
> User commission ("we need audits for this"): every transient state × refresh, live-driven —
> composer prefill, decision card (re-arms, U4), approaches, banners/toasts, minimized/restored
> window state (currently in-memory only — prime suspect), DR mode, settings tab, panel
> positions. Verdict per cell: survives / re-arms / lost. Audit DOC first (the Phase-1
> pattern); fixes follow as findings.

### G6 — settings keeps its LEFT rail (user preference) · **OPEN**
> The container-620 switch flips the rail to top-tabs when the modal narrows (snapped/narrow
> windows). Retune so the left rail survives far narrower (shrink the fluid rail first; stack
> only as the last resort); matrix-gated.

### G7 — fold The House (approaches) into the sidebar · **AWAITING PRODUCT VERDICT**
> User: the floating House window is redundant with the sidebar's house section.
> Recommendation on the table: approach rows under the game-status sidebar section (the
> rulings #3/#4/#10 drift), retiring the floating window; E89 belt stays; mobile = drawer.

### G8 — casting finalization must not read as an outage · **OPEN**
> User report: slow interview filing → momentary "engine unreachable" error → recovery.
> Mechanism (verify with a timed run): createCharacter's soul-seeding batch blocks the event
> loop through the SYNCHRONOUS embedding bridge; /health times out; the banner fires. Fix:
> chunk the seeding so the loop breathes (engine), and suppress the red banner while
> createCharacter is in flight in favor of an in-fiction holding line (FE).

### Lane G wave 2 (commissioned 2026-06-11: "cover it all including root causes") — G10–G15

> Each item names its ROOT CAUSE and fixes the pattern, not the instance. Dispatch is gated
> on wave-1 file ownership (one owner per file); items launch as their blockers merge.

### G10 — the cast window composes the kit · **QUEUED (after G9 — same file)**
> User: cast window's close dead, no minimize, alien visual language, "basically broken."
> ROOT CAUSE: post-kit drift — 0051 landed mid-campaign with hand-rolled chrome + its own
> Escape handler (ratchet-grandfathered with this exact pointer). Fix: the social/finale
> migration pattern; DELETE the bespoke chrome + private Escape; SHRINK the ratchet
> grandfather list. PLUS tighten the runtime ratchet: any fixed-position element carrying
> close/minimize-shaped controls must be `[data-ow-window]` or the gate fails (closes the
> hand-rolled-chrome-without-censused-signatures hole).

### G11 — the failure ring becomes the standard sink for every user-facing fail-open · **QUEUED (after G1 + G8)**
> ROOT CAUSE: the house `catch (_) {}` fail-open idiom is correct UX but structurally
> silent — every feature failure renders as absence (the image-gen complaint generalized).
> Fix: one tiny FE reporter (surface, errorClass, durationMs → the G1 ring; never throws,
> never blocks) and a sweep wiring it into the user-facing fail-open catches: panel polls,
> in-fiction web search, TTS/voice, mid-turn agent tool failures (quiet OOC note + ring),
> theme particles when A5 lands. The G1 card then shows EVERYTHING that silently failed.

### G12 — every soul-write burst breathes · **QUEUED (after G8 — same seam)**
> ROOT CAUSE: the ADR-0004 embedding bridge is synchronous per call; ANY batched soul write
> pins the engine event loop (creation was just the loudest site). Fix at the seam, not the
> site: move G8's chunk-and-yield INTO the shared soul-write path (SoulStore/seeding helper)
> so eviction nights, finale bursts, season restarts, and future batch sites inherit it;
> /health stays answerable during every burst (the G8 integration test generalized).
> Note the R3 ledger item (O(events) snapshot export) compounds late-season — measure both
> in the same harness; if week-10+ turn latency still breaches, promote R3's
> incremental-snapshot item out of "if play feels it" (the playtest has now felt it).

### G13 — the trim-zombie sweep: gating must cascade · **QUEUED (after wave 1 merges — tree-wide sweep)**
> ROOT CAUSE: the game build hides ITEMS but not their PARENTS/launchers (the Tools chevron
> instance generalized). Fix as a RULE: a container with zero visible actionable children
> hides itself; an affordance whose action is build-refused is hidden, not click-refused.
> Sweep: the shortcuts modal's bindings for dropped verticals, overflow-menu items, empty
> settings tabs for non-admins, rail icons across build transitions. Gate: a browser-smoke
> walk asserting every visible interactive element under the game build produces a visible
> effect (the G3 assertion generalized beyond the sidebar).

### G14 — one z-authority for restored modals · **QUEUED (after G2 — same file)**
> ROOT CAUSE (the F9 tail, now user-adjacent): modalManager's `_bringToFront` stamps
> `z-index ~300s !important` while ui.js promotes opens to ~1000s plain — inline !important
> wins, so a dock-restored tool window likely sits ABOVE every newly opened window until
> clicked (build=0; verify live first). Fix: `_bringToFront` defers to the ONE counter
> (ui.js's promote, or a shared module both consume) — no !important. Pull this F9 tail
> forward instead of waiting for the full W15 migration.

### G15 — event-driven freshness: `orwell:gamechanged` dispatch sweep · **QUEUED (wave 2)**
> ROOT CAUSE: sidebar/panel surfaces are poll-based (20–25s) and the `gamechanged` event is
> dispatched inconsistently, so post-action UI lags up to a poll period ("the sidebar is
> behind"). Fix: every FE path that mutates engine state (advanceGame, submitDecision,
> recordInteraction, createCharacter, new-game, casting updates) dispatches
> `orwell:gamechanged` on success — one helper at the tool-executor seam, not per-call-site
> copies; panels already listen.

> **Also recorded:** G5's audit findings will spawn G16+ fix items on landing; G4 (one
> visual language) additionally covers the cast window's px/rem discipline and the three
> chip languages (approach/decision/dock) under the shared tokens.
