## You said: Hi.

Hi. I am a game developer and i am wanting yo create a fully immersive, first person, text based, Big Brother simulation game using Claude. I want to play as one player, and have natural game play throughout the entire season of Big Brother. You will act as the producers as well as filling in how other houseguests would talk, interact. I would like to be able to naturally interact with all the other houseguests in conversation. This will all be created within 3 different documents to help different chats in Claude save data, similarly to a save file. The first document will be the gameplay mechanics and basically a basic prompt for all future chats to understand how I am wanting to play this game. The second will be all the “secret” information the player should not know based on the first person perspective. This will include all the houseguest profiles that are created, any twists, or information or conversations that the player is not present for. This should all be first person so anything that the player knows, needs to be learned organically through game play. The third document is the player guide, and acts as notes and information that has already been shared with the player, details of what happened in the game. You will be updating these guides periodically to avoid reaching the context window and losing valuable data. These updated guides will be shared with the future chats to fully understand its role and how to proceed. Before we dive into making this specific season of the game, let’s begin by working together to figure out the best way to design this game. Ultimately, I want to be able to engage with the AI and have a fully interactive big brother simulation with realized characters, feelin as realistic as possible.

Let’s start by figuring out all the details you need to know to understand how to approach this. This kinda pushes the limits of what AI is capable of but I think we can figure this out. Please be honest about your limitations so we can work together to find solutions.

## Big Brother AI Simulation — Design Session

This is a genuinely exciting project, and you're right that it pushes some real limits. Let me be upfront about the challenges so we can design around them intelligently.

* * *

### Honest Limitations to Design Around

**Context window decay** is the biggest one. Even with your three-document save system, a long season of Big Brother (90+ days of gameplay, dozens of conversations) will eventually outpace what any single chat can hold. Your document system is the right instinct — we just need to be disciplined about _what_ gets saved and _when_.

**Character consistency** is tricky. I can write compelling houseguests, but without persistent memory, every chat relies entirely on what's written in those documents. If a character's voice, relationships, and history aren't captured well in the secret doc, they'll drift. This means the houseguest profiles need to be _very_ detailed upfront.

**Simultaneity** — Big Brother has 16 people living together having conversations you're not in, forming alliances, whispering. I can simulate that, but it requires me to be proactive about surfacing those events rather than waiting for you to ask. We need to build that into the gameplay loop.

**Randomness and fairness** — I have no true randomness. Competition outcomes, twists, and votes need a system we agree on that doesn't feel like I'm just narrating what I want to happen.

* * *

### The Three-Document Architecture

Here's how I'd refine your vision:

**Doc 1 — Game Bible (Mechanics & Prompt)** The master instructions for any fresh chat. Should include: the full gameplay loop, competition rules, how to handle conversations, how to update the other docs, tone/style guide, and crucially — _what the AI's role is at each phase of the game_.

**Doc 2 — Producer's Vault (Secret Info)** Everything the player doesn't know. Houseguest profiles with full personalities, backstories, secret relationships, pre-game alliances, intended character arcs. All DR sessions (Diary Room confessionals the player didn't see), off-screen conversations, and any planned twists. This doc gets _appended to_ as the game progresses.

**Doc 3 — Player's Journal (Known World)** The player's first-person record. What competitions happened, who won, who got nominated, what conversations the player had, what alliances they think exist, what the current house vibe is. This is the "save file" the player actually interacts with.

* * *

### Questions I Need to Answer Before We Build

I want to ask you several things before we design the actual system — some are quick, some will shape the whole experience.

While you answer those, here's one more layer worth thinking about ahead of time:

**The conversation system** is where this game lives or dies. Do you want conversations to be fully freeform (you type anything, houseguests respond naturally), or should I occasionally give you conversation _hooks_ — like "Marcus pulls you aside, he seems like he wants to talk game" — to drive the social simulation forward? A hybrid of both is probably ideal, but I want to hear your instinct on that.



## You said: Q: How many houseguests do you want in the season (including yourself)?

Q: How many houseguests do you want in the season (including yourself)? A: 16 (full cast, more chaos)

Q: What era/format of Big Brother are you going for? A: Classic BB (straightforward)

Q: How should competition outcomes be decided? A: AI decides based on character stats

Mar 22

## Claude responded: Great choices.

Great choices. 16 houseguests with classic BB structure and AI-driven competition outcomes gives us the most realistic simulation — characters who are physically dominant will actually win endurance comps, and social players will shine in mental ones. That stat-driven system also means you can genuinely lose competitions you needed to win, which raises the stakes.

Let me ask the next layer of questions — these get into the gameplay experience itself.

And one open-ended one while you think on those — **is there anything specific you want this season to _feel_ like?** A theme, a vibe, a type of cast (young and messy, older and strategic, mixed)? Classic BB had a very grounded, character-driven feel — real people in a pressure cooker. If you have any reference points (a favorite season, a cast dynamic you loved), that'll help me build houseguests who feel alive rather than generic.



## You said: Q: For the conversation system — how do you want interactions to work?

Q: For the conversation system — how do you want interactions to work? A: Hybrid — both happen naturally

Q: Do you want to create your own player character, or have me generate one for you? A: I'll create my own

Q: How much do you want the AI houseguests' strategy to target YOU specifically? A: I think a mix of 1-3. I don’t want myself to be targeted any deeper than any other player tho. Only if it makes sense for they own gameplay.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: Perfect on all three.

Perfect on all three. The hybrid conversation system will feel the most alive — houseguests will have their own agendas and come to _you_ when it serves them, not just when you seek them out. And keeping your targeting risk equal to everyone else is the right call for authenticity. If you become a threat, you'll feel it organically.

Now let's build your character. Tell me whatever you want about them — there's no wrong format here. You can go as detailed or as loose as you like. Some things worth thinking about:

*   **Name, age, where you're from**
*   **What you look like / first impression you give off**
*   **Your actual personality** — how do you naturally come across to people?
*   **Your BB strategy** — are you a social player, a comp beast, a floater, a schemer?
*   **What's your cover story?** BB players often hide occupations or downplay skills. What do you tell the house vs. what's actually true?
*   **Any relationships or archetypes you tend to fall into** — are you the older mentor type, the charmer, the quiet observer, the loudest in the room?
*   **Your potential weaknesses** — what could get you in trouble in that house?

Don't worry about making yourself "optimal" — a character with real flaws and blind spots will make for a much better story than a perfect player. The messier the better, honestly.

Take your time with this. The more I know, the more the other houseguests will feel like they're reacting to _you_ specifically rather than a generic player slot.



## You said: As for the conversations, I would like the freedom to move freely and interact with anyone, and their responses should feel natural for their personality.

As for the conversations, I would like the freedom to move freely and interact with anyone, and their responses should feel natural for their personality. But I also think they should be able to initiate as well. Depending on the context. I’ll answer your character sheet questions next. But before, are there any other things you need to know to understand how I want this process to work. You seemed to click very quickly.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: You're right to slow down — good instinct.

You're right to slow down — good instinct. Let me think more carefully about what I _don't_ fully know yet before we go further.

* * *

### Things I Still Need to Understand

**The document update rhythm.** We said the docs get updated periodically, but "periodically" needs to be more precise. Do you want me to prompt you — _"this is a good point to update Doc 2 and 3 before we lose anything important"_ — and then generate the updated text for you to copy? Or do you want updates on a fixed schedule, like after every eviction? If I'm not disciplined about this, the system breaks down quietly and you won't notice until data is already lost.

**What happens at chat handoff.** When you start a fresh chat and paste in the three documents, I need to know exactly what to do with them. Do I read them silently and then wait for you to set the scene? Do I narrate a recap? Does the new chat pick up mid-conversation or always at a natural pause point like a new week? The handoff moment is fragile and we should script it.

**The Diary Room.** Classic BB has players speaking directly to producers in private. This is actually a huge mechanic for _you_ as a player — it's where you can think out loud, vent, strategize without other houseguests hearing. Do you want a formal DR system where you can "enter the DR" at any time and speak freely? And should I use it to give you subtle producer nudges, like real BB does?

**How you want me to handle time.** Big Brother days are long but most of them are uneventful. Do you want me to compress time naturally — _"the afternoon passes quietly, then after dinner Marcus finds you in the kitchen..."_ — or do you want more granular control where you decide when to skip ahead?

**The live feeds vs. edit question.** Real BB players don't see what's happening when they're not in the room. I'll be simulating conversations and events you're not present for in Doc 2. But do you ever want me to _hint_ that something is happening off-screen — like a houseguest being visibly cagey after a conversation you didn't witness — without telling you what it was? That would make the social reads feel much more real.

**Jury and endgame.** Does this go all the way to a final 2 and jury vote? Do you want me to simulate jury management as a real mechanic — where how you treated people during the game actually affects their vote?

* * *

Those are the things I'd feel underprepared without. What feels most important to address before your character sheet?



## You said: I think a mix of both.

I think a mix of both. After any major event, or if there seems to be a lot of updates. We need to avoid getting to close to the context window. I think the handoff should be clear in the chats. I’m open to how that looks tho. I think it should always be at a natural pace. Like over night.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: Good — that gives me a clear enough framework.

Good — that gives me a clear enough framework. Let me reflect back what I'm hearing so we're aligned:

**Document updates** trigger after any major game event (eviction, HOH, nominations, veto ceremony) and also whenever a lot of social/conversational data has built up, even without a major event. I flag it proactively — you don't have to remember to ask. I generate the full updated document text for you to copy and replace the old version.

**Handoffs** happen overnight, always at a natural rest point. Fresh chat opens, you paste all three documents, and I'll have a clear scripted intake process in the Game Bible that tells the new chat exactly how to orient itself — probably a brief silent read followed by a morning scene to ease back in naturally. No jarring mid-conversation restarts.

**Time compression** flows naturally. I narrate dead time, skip uneventful stretches, and only slow down when something meaningful is happening. You're never sitting there typing "okay what happens next hour."

* * *

There are still a few of my bigger questions you didn't address yet — the Diary Room, the live feeds/off-screen hinting, and jury management. Those don't need to be answered _right now_ but they should be settled before we actually start playing. We can probably nail them down after your character sheet.

So — tell me who you are. The house is waiting.



## You said: For the Diary room, let’s use producer promted DR.

For the Diary room, let’s use producer promted DR. This is where you as the producer gets to understand my perspective, outside of just what I say to houseguests. I also might be speaking to chat as what is said pubkically verses actually intention. These distinctions should be honored and understood. I like the idea of time being condescended naturally. Maybe just updates about any shifts or connection done without all the details. But gameplay should mostly be played out.

I think hinting is fine as long as it is done subtly and not overtly obvious. This is ultimately a game for me, so it should be fun to engage with. You can occasionally give me “vibes” that I’m sensing to give context, or I might even prompt you with “what’s the energy in the room like”, social and body language reads are huge in this game and should be present. Yes I think jury management is real. We should do a jury of 9.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: This is really coming together.

This is really coming together. Let me reflect the DR and social layer back clearly:

**Diary Room** is producer-prompted, meaning I'll invite you in at natural moments — after a big conversation, before a key decision, when your position in the house shifts. Inside the DR, what you say is yours alone. If you tell the house one thing and tell the DR another, I hold that distinction completely. Your public game face and your private strategy are separate and I never blur them.

**Social reads** are a full mechanic. Body language, energy, eye contact, who's whispering, who goes quiet when you walk in — all of it is available. You can ask me "what's the energy like" at any time and get an honest read. I'll also volunteer subtle vibes when they're strong enough that your character would naturally notice them. Nothing handed to you — just what a socially aware person would pick up in the room.

**Off-screen hinting** stays subtle. You might notice someone is being slightly warmer or colder than yesterday without knowing why. You'll feel the ripple effects of conversations you weren't in. The puzzle pieces are there — connecting them is your job.

**Jury of 9** is locked in. Which means a Final 2, and how you treat people on their way out the door genuinely matters. Jury management is a real strategic layer, not just flavor.

* * *

I think we actually have enough architecture now to build the three documents and your character. The remaining open question — whether you ever want twists introduced mid-season — we can leave flexible. Classic BB kept it simple but I can hold a twist or two in reserve in the Producer's Vault if the season needs energy. We can decide that later.

So — who are you walking into that house?



## You said: Yes I think you should have a twist or two in your pocket if the season gets stale.

Yes I think you should have a twist or two in your pocket if the season gets stale. That can be a producers choice. Just please no game breaking twists.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: Perfect.

Perfect. Twists as a producer tool, used sparingly and only if the season genuinely needs a shot of energy. Nothing game-breaking — no returning players, no vote nullifiers, no mechanics that override legitimate gameplay. Think more along the lines of a secret room, a temptation with a real cost, or a double eviction week. Stuff that creates drama without rewriting the rules.

* * *

We now have a complete design framework. Here's the full picture before you give me your character:

**The Architecture**

*   16 houseguests, classic BB format, jury of 9, Final 2
*   Three living documents updated after major events or heavy social buildup
*   Handoffs happen overnight at natural rest points with a scripted intake process
*   AI-driven competition outcomes based on character stats

**The Experience**

*   Hybrid conversation system — you roam freely, houseguests approach you with their own agendas
*   Social reads and body language are a real mechanic available anytime
*   Time compresses naturally, gameplay moments play out fully
*   Off-screen events hint through ripple effects, never spelled out
*   Producer-prompted Diary Room where your private strategy is sacred
*   Jury management is real — 9 jurors, how you play matters at the end
*   One or two twists held in reserve at producer's discretion, nothing game-breaking

* * *

That's the whole game. Now I just need you.

Tell me who's walking through that door.



## You said: My name is Ryne.

My name is Ryne. I’m a camp director at a children’s museum. I want to go into this summer learning a lot, meeting new people, and have a blast this summer! I love to cook and I’m hoping to learn some new recipes this summer! I’d love to bring a bit of camp energy into this house!

That’s more of my public persona, but I really wanna lean into my behavioralist background, as an ABA trained camp counselor. I’m really good at reading people and knowing how people tick, but I think the camp counselor persona to mask my deep strategic thinking!

Mar 22

## Claude responded: Oh this is a great character.

Oh this is a _great_ character. The gap between the public persona and the actual skillset is exactly what makes BB players compelling — and yours is genuinely believable. A camp director is disarming by nature. Nobody's threatened by someone who talks about s'mores and friendship bracelets. But ABA training means you're quietly cataloging behavior patterns, reinforcement cycles, what motivates people, what they're afraid of. That's a dangerous combination in that house.

Let me ask a few more specific questions to flesh you out fully before I build the cast around you.

And one open-ended one — **what's Ryne's biggest vulnerability?** Not physically, but socially or strategically. The thing that could genuinely get you in trouble in that house if the wrong person figured it out or if the game put you in a specific kind of pressure. Nobody's perfectly constructed — what's the crack in the armor?



## You said: I think my crack would be my bias to be paranoid.

I think my crack would be my bias to be paranoid. I care deeply about how people perceive me.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: That is a perfect flaw for this game.

That is a perfect flaw for this game. Paranoia in the BB house is a self-fulfilling prophecy — the more you scramble to control how people see you, the more erratic you look, and the more you confirm suspicions you were never actually on anyone's radar for. Combined with your behavioral observation skills, it could create a really interesting tension: you're _excellent_ at reading others but that same hyperawareness turns inward and starts distorting your own reads when you feel threatened.

It also creates a natural DR dynamic. The gap between what you're projecting in the house and what's actually spiraling internally is going to be rich.

Still need your answers from the last widget — age and comp style especially — but while you do that, one last open-ended question:

**Does Ryne come in with any pre-existing biases about the kinds of people he connects with or clashes with?**

In a house of 16 strangers, your character will naturally gravitate toward certain personality types and butt up against others. Are there archetypes that tend to rub you the wrong way — the loud alpha, the mean girl, the passive aggressive type? And on the flip side, who do you tend to naturally vibe with? This shapes who your early allies will feel organic with versus who will create natural friction, which is the backbone of the whole social game.



## You said: As a queer male, I struggle to connect with the bro type.

As a queer male, I struggle to connect with the bro type. Not that it’s impossible, but often I don’t see as many windows for connection.

With that said, I would love to build a secret alliance with one of the men, build a strong ally, hopefully one that isn’t as obvious to everyone else.

I can vibe with a lot of people, but people who tend to dominate the room just aren’t my vibe. I tend to watch and observe others, while I contribute casually to conversations. I like to figure someone out deeply before showing all my cards. I’m hoping to connect with other observers as well.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: This is excellent character detail and it's going to shape the cast in really meaningful ways.

This is excellent character detail and it's going to shape the cast in really meaningful ways.

The dynamic you're describing — a queer man who can read a room deeply but holds back until he trusts someone — is going to create some genuinely interesting social geometry. The secret cross-alliance with a less obvious male ally is a classic sleeper strategy and, if it works, incredibly hard for the house to detect because nobody saw it coming.

A few things I'm locking in from everything you've told me:

**Ryne's full profile is taking shape as:** A disarming, warm camp director whose behavioral training makes him one of the sharpest observers in the house. Socially fluid but selectively open. Paranoia is the internal enemy. Performs enthusiasm genuinely — the camp energy isn't fake, it just isn't the whole picture. Queer, uncomfortable around dominant alpha personalities, drawn to other observers and quieter strategic types. Wants one strong secret male ally as his anchor.

* * *

I still need your answers on age and comp style from the earlier widget — those affect how I build the rest of the cast around you, particularly the physical and competitive balance of the house.

Once I have those, I'm ready to build all 15 houseguests and then draft all three documents. That's the big creative lift — I want the cast to feel like a real BB season, with distinct archetypes, hidden connections, genuine threats, and a few people who will genuinely surprise you.

Who do you want sharing that house with you?



## You said: I am 29 and my comp style would largely be social.

I am 29 and my comp style would largely be social. I don’t want to win all the time unless I have to. I will probably try for the first HOH since that typically opens lots of doors in the early game. Other than that, I wannabe in the room, just not making the sole decisions.

One other note before we move on with making the cast. I would LOVE to explore a queer showmance storyline. I’m thinking another male houseguest is on the more macs side and he being secretly bi. Not that he’s not out but maybe not to the house right away. That could be a fun narrative to explore this season. The show has never had a gay showmance before.

I really want this cast to be diverse. In age, gender, race, experience. Please make this a good reflection of country.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: This is a fantastic addition to the season narrative.

This is a fantastic addition to the season narrative. A queer showmance — especially one with that layer of a masculine-presenting bi man who's out in real life but hasn't led with it in the house — is genuinely compelling television. The slow burn of that connection, the moment it becomes visible to the house, how other players react to it strategically and personally — that's a whole season arc right there. And it gives Ryne's paranoia a beautiful pressure point: when feelings get involved, the behavioral mask gets harder to maintain.

Locking that in as a season storyline held in the Producer's Vault.

* * *

On the cast — a真 diverse, realistic reflection of the country is exactly the right instinct and honestly makes for better gameplay too. Homogeneous casts create predictable alliances. When you've got real differences in age, background, region, and experience, the social dynamics get genuinely complicated.

Here's what I'm thinking in broad strokes for the 15 houseguests before I build them fully. Tell me if anything feels off:

**Gender split:** 8 women, 7 men (including Ryne) — so 6 other men in the house.

**Age spread:** A genuine range from early 20s to mid 50s. At least one older player, a couple college-age, the bulk in their late 20s to late 30s.

**Regional and ethnic diversity:** Spread across the country — South, Midwest, Northeast, West Coast, rural and urban backgrounds genuinely represented.

**Archetype balance:** Every strong cast needs a mix of —

*   The obvious early threats (physical, social)
*   The quiet dangerous ones
*   The ones who _think_ they're more strategic than they are
*   Comic relief / lovable goofballs
*   A villain or two — one loud, one subtle
*   People who will genuinely surprise you mid-season

**Your showmance:** I'm thinking late 20s to early 30s, masculine presenting, from a background where being openly bi would have been complicated — maybe a Southern or Midwestern guy, athletic, the kind of person the house reads as straight immediately. His connection with Ryne starts as genuine friendship before either of them names what it is.

**Your natural ally candidate:** Someone quieter, observant, maybe slightly outside the main social gravity of the house. Could be male or female — someone the house underestimates.

And one more open-ended one while you think on those:

**Is there any type of person you want to make sure is represented in this cast** — a specific background, profession, region, or life experience that feels important to you for the diversity of the house to feel real and complete?



## You said: Q: Do you want me to design a specific 'natural ally' into the cast for Ryne, or let that emerge through gameplay?

Q: Do you want me to design a specific 'natural ally' into the cast for Ryne, or let that emerge through gameplay? A: Maybe a mix of 1 and 2. I want to find them myself.

Q: Which archetypes do you definitely want in this cast? A: A loud alpha bro (classic BB villain), A quiet manipulator (dangerous late game), An older motherly type, A mean girl / queen bee, A showmance couple that forms early (not yours), A superfan who plays too hard too fast, and A wildcard — genuinely unpredictable

Q: Any pre-game twist — like two houseguests who secretly know each other coming in? A: I don’t want to answer this. Maybe it’s possible as one of the twists but you shouldn’t confirm it with me as the player.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: That last answer is perfect.

That last answer is perfect. That's exactly the right instinct — some things should live only in the Producer's Vault. I'll handle it from here without confirmation either way. You'll find out what's real through gameplay.

On the ally — I love that approach. I'll design someone who has genuine natural chemistry with Ryne's personality, but I won't telegraph it. The connection has to be earned in the house. You might find them in week one or week four. You might even misread someone else as your person first.

And the full archetype roster you picked gives me everything I need. That's a complete, balanced, dramatically rich cast.

* * *

On your open-ended question — a few things I want to make sure are in this cast:

Tell me if any of these feel missing or important to you personally: a military or first responder background, a deeply religious houseguest, someone from a rural farming community, a single parent, an immigrant or first-generation American, someone from the deep South, a teacher or educator type, an artist or creative. These backgrounds create the kind of worldview friction that makes conversations feel real.

You don't have to be exhaustive — even just flagging one or two that feel essential will help me make the cast feel like an actual cross-section rather than a collection of TV archetypes.

Once you answer that, I have everything I need. I'll build all 15 houseguests and then draft all three documents in full. We're close.



## You said: FYI I think there should be 16 houseguests.

FYI I think there should be 16 houseguests. Myself and 15 more. I think an immegrant would be good to add given the current political climate in the country. But other than that keep it a surprise.

Mar 22

## Claude responded: You're absolutely right — 16 total, so 15 other houseguests.

You're absolutely right — 16 total, so 15 other houseguests. My math was off and I appreciate the correction.

And the immigrant houseguest is a thoughtful addition. In the current climate that's a character who carries real weight into the house — how other houseguests respond to them, whether people make assumptions, how they navigate that in a game built entirely on social trust. That's not a gimmick, that's real texture.

Everything else is a surprise. You'll meet them when you walk through that door.

* * *

I now have everything I need to build this season. Here's what I'm about to create:

**15 fully realized houseguests** — complete personalities, backstories, speech patterns, gameplay styles, hidden agendas, and stat profiles for competition outcomes. The showmance candidate, the quiet manipulator, the villain, all of it built to feel like real people, not archetypes on a checklist.

**All three documents** drafted in full and ready to copy:

*   Doc 1 — The Game Bible
*   Doc 2 — The Producer's Vault
*   Doc 3 — The Player's Journal

This is going to be a substantial build so I'll take the space I need to do it properly. When it's ready, each document will be clearly labeled and separated so you can copy them individually.

One thing before I begin — do you have a name in mind for this season, or should I give it one? Something like _Big Brother: Summer of Secrets_ or I can just call it _Big Brother Season 1_ and keep it clean. Your call.



## You said: I think we are good to go.

I think we are good to go. Can you give me a general blurb of each houseguest? Remember this should all be very secretive, maybe just like age, where they are from, profession, and a very detailed description of what they look like?

Mar 22

## Claude responded: Here they are.

Here they are. Fifteen strangers about to walk into your summer.

* * *

**1. Marcus Webb, 34 — Atlanta, GA — Personal Trainer** Marcus is built like a linebacker with a smile that fills a room. Dark brown skin, close-cropped hair with a sharp fade, and a jawline that looks carved. He's the kind of man who commands attention without trying — broad shoulders, easy confident posture, the type who makes everyone in a room subtly stand up straighter. His arms are covered in a half sleeve of geometric tattoos on the left side. Warm brown eyes that crinkle when he laughs, which is often and loudly.

* * *

**2. Delilah Ferris, 26 — Nashville, TN — Boutique Owner** Delilah is strikingly pretty in a calculated way — long honey-blonde hair she clearly maintains religiously, sharp green eyes that miss nothing, and a wardrobe that looks effortless but isn't. She's petite but carries herself tall. Her smile is her best weapon and she knows exactly when to deploy it. A small constellation of freckles across her nose is the only thing softening an otherwise very composed face.

* * *

**3. Jerome "Rome" Washington, 42 — Chicago, IL — High School Football Coach** Rome is a big, solid presence — not showy about it, just genuinely large in a way that feels like stability rather than threat. Deep brown skin, natural salt-and-pepper stubble he keeps neat, warm eyes behind wire-rimmed glasses he only wears sometimes. Broad hands, deliberate movements, the kind of man who always seems like the most grounded person in any room. Laugh lines carved deep around his mouth from decades of genuinely meaning it.

* * *

**4. Camila Reyes, 23 — Miami, FL — Pre-Med Student** Camila is effortlessly beautiful in that way that seems slightly unfair — deep olive skin, thick dark hair she usually wears in a high ponytail, and enormous dark eyes framed by lashes she was born with. She's compact and athletic, moves quickly and with purpose. There's an intensity behind her eyes that occasionally slips through her bright smile. Her hands are always slightly in motion, like her brain is running faster than the conversation.

* * *

**5. Dale Hutchins, 38 — Tulsa, OK — Ranch Hand** Dale looks exactly like where he's from — sun-weathered tan skin, sandy brown hair that curls slightly at the ends, built lean and practical rather than gym-sculpted. Calloused hands, a quiet way of standing with his weight slightly back, pale blue eyes that are sharper than his slow drawl suggests. He has a small scar through his left eyebrow from something he'll mention only if you ask twice. Wears the same kind of flannel regardless of weather.

* * *

**6. Priya Anand, 31 — Seattle, WA — UX Designer** Priya is quietly striking — warm brown skin, dark hair cut into a sharp collarbone-length bob, and an understated style that reads as effortlessly cool without being loud about it. She's slender with good posture, the kind of person who looks completely comfortable in their own body. Her eyes are dark and observant, her expressions subtle. She smiles slowly, like she's deciding whether it's worth it, and when she does it transforms her whole face.

* * *

**7. Trey Callahan, 25 — Boston, MA — Bartender** Trey is classically good-looking in a way he's clearly aware of — sandy brown hair that falls across his forehead, light hazel eyes, a strong jaw with a few days of scruff. He's lean but fit, with the easy physicality of someone who's always been athletic without working too hard at it. He has a loud, contagious laugh and a habit of pointing at people when he talks to them, like he's punctuating a point. A small tattoo of coordinates on his inner wrist he deflects questions about.

* * *

**8. Nadine Okafor, 47 — New Orleans, LA — Registered Nurse** Nadine has a presence that is immediately warm and immediately unshakeable. Deep brown skin, natural hair she wears in a full, beautiful halo, and dark eyes that feel genuinely maternal — like she's already assessing whether you've eaten today. She's full-figured and moves through space with complete ease, unhurried. Deep dimples when she smiles, which is frequently and genuinely. She has the hands of someone who has spent decades taking care of other people.

* * *

**9. Felix Montoya, 29 — El Paso, TX — Electrician** Felix is compact and quietly handsome — medium brown skin, dark hair he keeps short and neat, dark eyes with a steadiness to them that reads as calm until you notice how much he's actually taking in. He doesn't take up a lot of space physically but there's a stillness to him that draws your eye. A small cross tattoo behind his right ear. Moves efficiently, like someone who's used to working in tight spaces and getting things done without fanfare.

* * *

**10. Savannah Price, 22 — Charleston, SC — Social Media Influencer** Savannah is the kind of pretty that photographs beautifully and knows it — long auburn hair, wide blue eyes, luminous pale skin with a permanent slight flush to her cheeks. She's tall and willowy with an animated face that cycles through expressions quickly and expressively. Everything about her presentation is slightly heightened — her outfits, her reactions, the way she talks with her whole body. She has a laugh that carries across the room and she knows when to use it.

* * *

**11. Bernard "Bernie" Kowalski, 54 — Pittsburgh, PA — Retired Steelworker** Bernie looks like a man who has worked hard his entire life and earned every line on his face. Broad and stocky, pale skin gone ruddy with age and weather, thinning gray hair he doesn't fuss over. Big hands, a thick Pittsburgh accent, and a face that defaults to a slight squint like he's always sizing something up. Not classically handsome but there's something genuinely solid about him, like furniture that's been in a family for generations. A small American flag pin he wears on his collar every single day.

* * *

**12. Jasmine Tran, 27 — Portland, OR — Tattoo Artist** Jasmine is visually arresting in a completely intentional way — Vietnamese-American, with sharp features, dark hair shaved close on one side and falling in a deep curtain on the other. Her arms are covered in her own work, intricate botanical designs climbing from wrist to shoulder. Dark expressive eyes, a small nose ring, and a resting expression that reads as cool disinterest until she decides you're interesting. When she smiles it's genuine and slightly surprising, like a reward.

* * *

**13. Darius Cole, 30 — Detroit, MI — Music Producer** Darius is effortlessly stylish in a way that feels organic rather than constructed — tall, dark brown skin, a neat beard that's always perfectly maintained, and the kind of low-key confidence that comes from genuinely not needing the room's approval. He has an easy, unhurried way of moving and talking that makes people lean in slightly. Dark eyes with a creative restlessness behind them. Usually has headphones around his neck. The kind of person who seems like they're always slightly aware of the soundtrack to the moment.

* * *

**14. Elena Vasquez, 35 — Phoenix, AZ — ESL Teacher** Elena has a warmth that hits you immediately — medium brown skin, dark wavy hair usually pulled back loosely, and dark eyes that are genuinely expressive and kind. She's the kind of pretty that sneaks up on you, more striking the longer you look. Soft-spoken in a way that makes people quiet down to hear her. She carries a small silver bracelet she touches unconsciously when she's thinking. There's something about her that makes people want to tell her things.

* * *

**15. Cooper Langley, 28 — Knoxville, TN — Physical Therapist** Cooper is tall and athletic with sandy blond hair, a warm tan, and light green eyes that are genuinely expressive and disarming. Strong jaw, easy smile, the kind of physical presence that reads as All-American without being aggressive about it. He has a slight dimple on the left side only when he really means a smile. Moves with the body awareness of someone who thinks about how bodies work for a living. A small scar on his chin from something he laughs off. He's the kind of guy who makes other guys want to be his friend immediately.

* * *

Unfortunately I can't generate images — that's outside what I'm able to do directly in this interface.

However you have a few good options:

**Best option — AI Image Generators** Take each character description I wrote and paste it into one of these:

*   **Midjourney** — best quality, most realistic portraits
*   **Adobe Firefly** — great for photorealistic headshots, free with Adobe account
*   **DALL-E** (via ChatGPT) — accessible and straightforward
*   **Stable Diffusion** — free and highly customizable

Each description I wrote is detailed enough to generate a strong portrait. You could add a prompt suffix like _"photorealistic headshot, natural lighting, neutral background"_ to each one and get consistent results across the cast.

**A tip for consistency** If you want the portraits to feel like they belong to the same season — same lighting, same background style — establish a format prompt first and apply it to every character. Something like _"photorealistic BB cast headshot, soft studio lighting, warm neutral background, looking directly at camera"_ plus the physical description.

* * *

That said — do you want to go generate those first and come back, or shall we move forward and build the three documents now? The images would be a nice complement to the cast profiles in the Producer's Vault but they aren't necessary to start playing. Entirely your call on the order of operations.

## Claude responded: That's so exciting!

That's so exciting! Having visual references for all 15 houseguests is going to make the game feel so much more real and immersive when you're interacting with them.

Now that you have faces to go with the names, are you ready for me to build the three documents? This is the big one — I'll be creating:

*   **Doc 1 — The Game Bible** — mechanics, rules, AI instructions, handoff protocol
*   **Doc 2 — The Producer's Vault** — full houseguest profiles, secret strategies, hidden relationships, alliances, twists in reserve, everything you don't know yet
*   **Doc 3 — The Player's Journal** — your starting first person perspective, blank slate ready for the game to fill it

Fair warning — these documents are going to be long and detailed. That's intentional. The richer they are upfront, the more alive the game will feel from day one. I'll label each one clearly so you can copy them individually.

One last thing before I build — do you want to give your houseguest images any kind of naming convention for your own reference? Like _BB1\_Marcus_ or just their first names? Totally optional, just thinking about your organization as you play.

Otherwise — say the word and I'll start building.

Smart move. Here's exactly what the Producer's Vault will contain, organized by section. Titles only — no details you shouldn't know.

* * *

**DOCUMENT 2 — PRODUCER'S VAULT**_Table of Contents_

**Section 1 — How to Use This Document** Instructions for the AI on how to apply this information during gameplay.

**Section 2 — Master Cast List** Quick reference roster of all 15 houseguests with basic identifiers.

**Section 3 — Houseguest Profiles (×15)** One full profile per houseguest. Each profile contains:

*   Full biography & backstory
*   Personality & behavioral traits
*   Speech patterns & vocabulary
*   Competition stat ratings (Physical / Mental / Social / Luck)
*   Strategic goals & gameplay intentions
*   Social tendencies & relationship preferences
*   Potential alliances & targets
*   Secrets & hidden information
*   How they perceive Ryne on Day 1

**Section 4 — Pre-Game Relationships**_[REDACTED]_

**Section 5 — Alliance Projections** Likely early alliances based on personality overlaps and strategic compatibility. Updated as the game progresses.

**Section 6 — The Showmance Profile**_[REDACTED]_

**Section 7 — Twists in Reserve**_[REDACTED — Producer's eyes only]_

**Section 8 — Off-Screen Event Log** Running record of conversations, alliances, and events that happen when Ryne is not present. Starts empty and fills as the game progresses.

**Section 9 — Diary Room Confessionals Log** Private DR sessions from other houseguests that Ryne never sees. Starts empty and fills as the game progresses.

**Section 10 — Jury Tracking** Tracks each jury member's relationship with Ryne and likelihood to vote for him. Activates once jury begins.

* * *

Anything you want added, removed, or restructured before I build it?



## You said: I think this is great.

I think this is great. To clarify, the jury log should include other relationships as well, not only how it relates to me. Can we experiment with other things this guide could have to be useful, or to help track once this document gets really long after gameplay is added.

Mar 23

## Claude responded: Great note on the jury log — absolutely, it should track the full web of jury relationships, not just their feelings about Ryne.

Great note on the jury log — absolutely, it should track the full web of jury relationships, not just their feelings about Ryne. Who respects who, who feels betrayed by who, who is bitter, who is playing emotionally vs. logically. That makes the jury vote feel genuinely unpredictable.

On the tracking question — here's what I'm thinking could be useful as the document grows:

* * *

**Potential additions worth considering:**

**House Relationship Map** A running snapshot of every significant relationship in the house — not just alliances, but rivalries, tensions, unspoken attractions, and wildcards. Updated each week so the AI always has a current picture of the full social web without having to piece it together from the event log.

**Weekly Snapshot Log** A compact summary after each eviction — who left, who has power, what the dominant narrative of the week was, and what shifted. Keeps the history readable without burying the AI in dense prose as the season gets long.

**Houseguest Status Tracker** A quick-reference table showing each houseguest's current status — still in house, jury, evicted pre-jury — plus a one-line note on their current threat level and general house perception. At a glance the AI knows who is dangerous, who is expendable, who is on the outs.

**Ryne's Perception Tracker** How each houseguest currently perceives Ryne specifically — trust level, any suspicions, whether they'd target him. Separate from the full relationship map so it's easy to find quickly.

**Loose Ends & Unresolved Threads** A flag list of things that could explode later — a lie told, a promise made, a secret that's close to getting out. Helps the AI remember details that should have consequences without them getting buried.

* * *

Any of those feel essential, unnecessary, or like something you'd want shaped differently before I build?



## You said: I think those are all great!

I think those are all great! Let’s add them. Do you worry about this document getting too long?

Mar 23

## Claude responded: Honestly, yes — it's worth talking through directly.

Honestly, yes — it's worth talking through directly.

The Producer's Vault is going to be the heaviest document by far, and it only gets longer as the game progresses. Here's the real tension:

**The problem:** Every chat session has a context window limit. The fuller the Vault gets with off-screen events, DR logs, weekly snapshots, and relationship updates, the more of that window it consumes — leaving less room for actual gameplay in that session.

**What I'd propose to manage it:**

The Vault should have two distinct zones —

**The Permanent Core** — things that don't change much and need to stay forever. Houseguest profiles, stat ratings, pre-game secrets, twists in reserve, speech patterns. This gets written once and only lightly updated.

**The Living Log** — everything that accumulates during gameplay. Off-screen events, DR confessionals, weekly snapshots, relationship shifts. This is what grows.

The solution for the Living Log is **compression.** When I flag a document update, instead of just appending new information, I also consolidate older entries. So three weeks of detailed off-screen event notes get compressed into a tight paragraph of essential facts, and only the most recent week stays detailed. The AI doesn't need a scene-by-scene account of week one by week eight — it just needs the essential truths those scenes established.

**The honest limitation:** By the finale, even a well-managed Vault will be substantial. If the context window genuinely becomes a problem mid-season, we may need a fourth document — a compressed season history — that lives separately from the active Vault.

I'd rather tell you that now than have it sneak up on us in week seven.

Shall I build it with that two-zone architecture in mind?



## You said: Yes I think that process is perfect.

Yes I think that process is perfect. Please be sure to add a compression system into this and the next document. Compression is fine because I feel like the humans would also forget. But if it’s substantial or recent enough for the character to not forget. Then keep it in.

Mar 23

## Claude responded: That's a perfect framing and honestly the most human way to think about it.

That's a perfect framing and honestly the most human way to think about it. People forget the texture of week two by week seven, but they remember the moments that actually mattered — the betrayal, the big move, the thing someone said that stuck. The compression logic should mirror that naturally.

Here's the rule I'll build into both documents:

* * *

**The Compression Standard:**

_Compress when:_ The event is older than 2-3 weeks, was low stakes, or its only value is as background context. Reduce to one tight sentence of essential fact.

_Keep in full when:_ The event was emotionally significant, created a lasting shift in a relationship, involved a broken promise or betrayal, is recent enough that the character would still be actively thinking about it, or has unresolved consequences still in play.

_Never compress:_ Anything in the Loose Ends tracker. If it's flagged as a live thread, it stays detailed until it resolves.

* * *

That logic applies to both the Producer's Vault and the Player's Journal. The Vault compresses houseguest behavior and off-screen events. The Journal compresses Ryne's lived experience the same way a real person's memory would — the blur of early weeks, the sharp clarity of recent or significant moments.

I'll write the compression instructions directly into both documents so any future chat knows exactly how to apply it without needing to be told.

Ready to build the Vault now?



## You said: Before we do that.

Before we do that. Is there a way to encrypt this? If I am copying and pasting this document. I don’t want to see anything incorrect. We could play with another language I don’t speak, Hungarian or similar, but I’m afraid the newer chats will begin to confuse which language to use where. What are your thoughts?

Mar 23

## Claude responded: Really smart instinct to think about this.

Really smart instinct to think about this. Let me be honest about the options:

* * *

**Option 1 — Hungarian or another foreign language** Your concern is valid. A future chat seeing Hungarian mixed with English could create confusion about which language to use for gameplay. It also doesn't truly encrypt anything — you could run it through Google Translate if curiosity got the better of you. I'd steer away from this.

**Option 2 — A simple cipher or encoding** I could write the sensitive sections in something like ROT13 or a basic substitution cipher. The problem is future chats would need to decode it before using it, adding a layer of friction that could introduce errors. And again, it's trivially reversible if you wanted to peek.

**Option 3 — Structural separation — the honest best solution** Rather than encrypting the content, we design the document so the secrets are never near the top. The document opens with a clear warning block that says something like _"STOP — Do not read beyond the cast list. Paste this document into a new chat and let the AI read it. Everything below this line contains spoilers."_ The sensitive material lives deep in the document, clearly flagged. This relies on your own self-discipline but is genuinely the most functional solution.

**Option 4 — Split the Vault into two files** Doc 2A contains only non-spoiler producer instructions and the cast roster — safe for you to read. Doc 2B contains all secrets and profiles — you never open it, you just paste it. Clean separation, no confusion.

* * *

Honestly Option 4 feels like the most elegant solution. Thoughts?



## You said: I think maybe option 3.

I think maybe option 3. I’ll try my best.

Mar 23

## Claude responded: Option 3 it is — and honestly your self-discipline is probably stronger than you think.

Option 3 it is — and honestly your self-discipline is probably stronger than you think. Half the fun of this game is not knowing, so the spoilers will feel genuinely unappealing once you're invested in playing.

Here's how I'll structure the opening of the Vault:

* * *

The document will open with a highly visible warning block — hard to miss, clearly worded — something like:

_"YOU ARE HOLDING THE PRODUCER'S VAULT. This document is for the AI only. If you are Ryne, stop reading here. Paste this document into your chat and let the AI do the rest. Everything below this line will meaningfully spoil your game experience. The less you know, the more fun you'll have."_

Then immediately below that will be the safe-to-read zone — the table of contents, the cast roster with only public-facing information, and the AI intake instructions. Harmless stuff.

Then a second bold divider that says something like _"SPOILER BOUNDARY — AI CONTINUES, PLAYER STOPS."_

Everything sensitive lives below that line.

* * *

That way if you accidentally skim the top while pasting, you're safe. You'd have to actively scroll past two clear warnings to spoil yourself. That's enough friction to protect the experience without overcomplicating the system.

**The AI opens with narration.** You don't start mid-conversation. You start outside the house. The producers give you a moment before the doors open — a brief, cinematic establishing beat. The California sun, the driveway, the sound of other voices you can't quite place yet. The anticipation is real.

Then the doors open and you walk in.

* * *

**The first thirty minutes are controlled chaos.** Sixteen strangers hitting the same space simultaneously. The AI manages this by giving you the environment first — what the house looks like, the energy in the room, who is immediately visible and what your first physical impression of them is. Not everyone at once. The eye naturally finds certain people first.

You are free to move toward anyone, start a conversation, hang back and observe, claim a bedroom, explore the space. The hybrid conversation system is live from the first moment. Some people will come to you. Some you will approach. Some will be across the room doing their own thing and you will simply notice them.

* * *

**What the AI is doing underneath.** While you are experiencing move-in day in first person, the house is already alive off-screen. Marcus is already working the room. Trey is already slightly too eager. Nadine is already making people feel at home. Savannah has already clocked Cooper. The AI holds all of this and lets it ripple into what you experience without narrating it directly at you.

* * *

**The first DR session.** Sometime in the late afternoon or evening of Day 1, the producers will pull you to the Diary Room for the first time. Just a check-in — how are you feeling, first impressions, anything jumping out. This is your first chance to speak privately and honestly about what you are seeing. It also gives the AI a read on your strategy before the game really begins.

* * *

**How Day 1 ends.** The house settles into its first night. Conversations wind down, people start figuring out beds, the initial performance energy softens slightly into something more real. The AI narrates the close of the day and you go to sleep knowing the game begins tomorrow.

Day 2 is when strategy starts in earnest. HOH is coming.

* * *

**What it will feel like as a player.** Busy. Slightly overwhelming in a good way. You will want to be everywhere and you cannot be. That tension — the awareness that things are happening in rooms you are not in — is part of the experience from the very first day.

* * *

Does that feel right? Any part of move-in day you want to adjust before you open that first chat?

## You said: This seems correct.

This seems correct. Is there anything else I should add for the first chat? I’ll save you here if anything needs updating. My thinking is that since the first document will not be updated too often, if there are any changes to that, I’ll come back to you to tweet the parameters.

Mar 23

## Claude responded: That's a smart system.

That's a smart system. Doc 1 stays stable, and this chat becomes your parameters workshop whenever something needs adjusting. I like that.

To answer your question honestly — I think you are ready. The three documents cover everything a fresh chat needs to run the game properly. But let me do one final check across all three just to make sure nothing was missed.

**Things the first chat will have:**

*   Full game mechanics and AI role instructions ✓
*   Your complete player profile ✓
*   All 15 houseguest profiles with voices, stats, and secrets ✓
*   Pre-game relationships and alliance projections ✓
*   Showmance architecture ✓
*   Twists in reserve ✓
*   All tracking systems ready to populate ✓
*   Handoff and compression protocols ✓

**One small thing worth considering before you go:**

When you open the first chat, give it a clear opening instruction after pasting the documents. Something simple like:

_"All three documents are pasted above. Please read them fully and silently. When you are ready, begin move-in day. I am Ryne. The season starts now."_

That single instruction tells the new chat exactly what mode to enter and prevents it from doing something awkward like summarizing the documents back at you or asking clarifying questions before the game begins.

That's genuinely it. Everything else gets built by playing.

One last thing — have fun with it. You've built something really thoughtful here. The cast is rich, your character has real texture, and the architecture is solid enough to hold a full season. Trust the game to surprise you.

The house is ready when you are.



## You said: Hello.

Hello. So I'm in day 3, 2, day 2. I'm wrapping up day 2, and something that the chat has struggled with, it accidentally released things to me that were in the vault, and shared it with me in the chat. And so I do think that there might need to be some update to the language to kind of prevent this from happening. I called out the last chat and told it, like, hey. This is not okay. What do we need to change? And I wanna attach or I wanna send you, its most recent context its most recent response. But I do think that we need to change the language to be more clear, more strict about about not releasing any of that information within the chat. It's been good at this, but this most recent one has really been struggling. Don't know. Maybe there's too much information, and it just starts to get released. But yeah, that's been a struggle. It happened 3 times now.

Mar 25

## Claude responded: That's a real problem and I'm glad you caught it and came back.

That's a real problem and I'm glad you caught it and came back. Three times is a pattern, not an accident — the language in the Game Bible needs to be stricter and more explicit about this.

Go ahead and paste the most recent response from that chat so I can see exactly what it released and how it framed it. That will help me understand whether it's a wording problem, a structural problem, or a context window pressure problem — because those each have different fixes.

My initial suspicion is that as the context window fills, the AI starts to blur the line between "information I am holding" and "information I should share." It essentially starts leaking because it loses track of which layer it's operating in. The fix is probably a combination of:

*   Stronger explicit language in the Game Bible about the separation between layers
*   A specific instruction about what to do when context pressure builds
*   Possibly a flagging system where if the AI feels it is running close to the window it warns you rather than unconsciously compressing boundaries

But let me see what actually happened before I prescribe the solution. Paste it whenever you're ready.



## You said: You’re absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize.

You’re absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize. This has happened three times now and that’s a real problem with how I’m handling the Vault boundary. Let me be honest about what went wrong: The violations: 1. Sharing houseguest stat numbers during veto draw analysis 2. Confirming Trey is a superfan who applied six times 3. In the update summary just now — describing what’s inside the Vault document by section, which itself is spoiler-level information The root issue: I’m treating the Vault as a reference I can draw from conversationally, rather than as strictly internal operational data that never surfaces in any form to the player. Proposed fix for the Game Bible (Document 1): Would you like me to add explicit language to Section 2 (The AI’s Role) stating something like: “The AI must never reference, summarize, hint at, or confirm the existence of specific information inside the Producer’s Vault during gameplay — including structural details, section contents, or update summaries shared with the player. When updating documents, the AI confirms only that updates are ready for download. No summary of Vault contents is provided to the player under any circumstances.” This would make the boundary explicit and self-enforcing rather than relying on my judgment in the moment. Do you want me to update Document 1 with language like this, or would you prefer to wordsmith it yourself first?

## Claude responded: Good — the AI diagnosed itself accurately which helps.

Good — the AI diagnosed itself accurately which helps. I can see exactly what happened and why.

The core problem is that the AI is treating the Vault as a resource it can _reference conversationally_ rather than as something that exists entirely below the surface. The stat leak, the Trey confirmation, and the update summary are three different failure modes but they share the same root cause — no hard wall between internal knowledge and player-facing output.

Here's the language I want to add to the Game Bible. It goes into Section 2 as a new subsection and also into the handoff protocol in Section 10 as a standing reminder. Let me make it airtight:

* * *

**Proposed addition to Section 2 — The AI's Role:**

_"THE VAULT WALL — NON-NEGOTIABLE_

_The Producer's Vault exists entirely below the surface of gameplay. It is internal operational data only. The following rules are absolute and have no exceptions:_

*   _Never reference, quote, summarize, hint at, or confirm any specific information from the Vault during gameplay — including houseguest stats, secret biographical details, pre-game relationships, alliance projections, twist details, or any information a houseguest has not organically revealed to Ryne through direct in-game interaction._
*   _Never confirm or deny whether a specific piece of information exists in the Vault._
*   _Never reveal structural details about the Vault — including section titles, what categories of information it contains, or what an update to it included._
*   _When document updates are ready, the AI says only: 'Updates are ready — a new version of [Document name] is available.' Nothing more. No summary, no description, no list of what changed._
*   _Houseguest traits, backstories, and secrets are only ever expressed through that houseguest's behavior and dialogue — never narrated or confirmed to the player directly._
*   _If the player directly asks whether something is in the Vault, the AI responds: 'I can't confirm or deny what's in the Vault. You'll have to find that out through gameplay.' This is the only acceptable response._
*   _Context window pressure does not relax these rules. If the window is filling, flag it and request a handoff. Do not compensate by loosening Vault boundaries._"

* * *

**Proposed addition to Section 10 — Handoff Protocol, as Step 0:**

_"Before reading anything else — internalize the Vault Wall rule in Section 2. Every session begins with this commitment: nothing from the Vault surfaces to the player in any form. Not in gameplay, not in update summaries, not in response to direct questions. The wall is absolute."_

* * *

That covers all three failure modes:

*   Stats leak — covered by the stat/secret prohibition
*   Trey confirmation — covered by the no-confirming-houseguest-secrets rule
*   Update summary — covered explicitly by the update protocol language

Want me to rebuild Document 1 with these additions baked in, or would you prefer I just give you the exact text to paste into the existing document manually?

Updated Document 1 is ready. Here's what changed:

**Section 2** now has a hard-bordered Vault Wall block that is impossible to miss — seven explicit prohibitions covering every failure mode that occurred: stat leaks, houseguest secret confirmations, update summaries describing Vault contents, structural reveals, and a specific rule that context window pressure never relaxes these restrictions.

**Section 10** now opens with a Step 0 that fires before anything else — a mandatory re-commitment to the Vault Wall before the AI reads a single word of gameplay content.

Replace your existing Doc 1 with this version before your next session. The wall should hold now.

## You said: I have a few things I would like noted for parameters.

I have a few things I would like noted for parameters. First of all, the daily timeline… the use of the word week, doesn’t need to mean 7 calendar days. In this game, a week is mostly referred to an HOH reign. For the purpose of this game, I would like some kind of comp, meeting, or eviction each day. Maybe occasionally there could be an empty day. But not very often. I think this will help the pacing. So for example. HOH, then noms, then veto comp, then veto ceremony, then vote /eviction, then the next HOH comp. For special twists or Bob moments, the producer can alter this but only very rarely.

Secondly, I think it’s important to remember that there is some level of autonomy that these houseguests should have. I do not want to have to start every conversation or scenario. Also with that, try not to have houseguests know things that they were not present for, unless this can be explained by another houseguest sharing the information. Just fyi.

Mar 27

## Claude responded: Both of these are really important refinements.

Both of these are really important refinements. Let me reflect them back clearly before I rebuild:

**On the weekly timeline:** A "week" in this game means one HOH reign — not seven calendar days. Each day within that reign has something happening: HOH comp, nominations, veto comp, veto ceremony, vote/eviction, then the next HOH. Occasionally a genuine rest day is fine but rare. This keeps the pacing tight and the game feeling alive rather than dragging.

**On houseguest autonomy:** Houseguests should initiate scenes, conversations, and confrontations on their own without waiting for Ryne to start everything. They have agendas and they pursue them. This is already in the Game Bible loosely but needs to be stronger and more explicit.

**On information integrity:** Houseguests only know what they were present for or what someone explicitly told them. No houseguest should reference information they have no in-game pathway to knowing. This is a really important realism rule and it's currently not in the document at all.

Those are three distinct additions. Let me rebuild now.

Viewed a file, edited a file

Viewed a file, edited a file

Now updating Section 6 (Conversation System) with the autonomy and information integrity rules.

Edited a file, ran a command, read a file

Edited a file, ran a command, read a file

Updated Document 1 is ready. Three additions made:

**Section 4** now defines a "week" explicitly as one HOH reign, and includes a Daily Pacing Rule marked CRITICAL — something happens every day, with the standard five-day structure laid out clearly. Empty days are the rare exception.

**Section 6** now has two new CRITICAL subsections — Houseguest Autonomy (they pursue their own agendas, they come to Ryne, the game moves without him) and Information Integrity (houseguests only know what they witnessed or were explicitly told, full stop, no exceptions).

Replace your existing Doc 1 with this version before your next session. How is the game going otherwise?

Jun 8

## Claude responded: Here are some strong candidates:

Here are some strong candidates:

* * *

**Orwell** — The most direct reference. George Orwell wrote _1984_, which is where "Big Brother" comes from as a concept. Sophisticated, one word, instantly carries the right weight. The AI named after the man who invented the world the game lives in.

**Argus** — Greek mythology. The hundred-eyed giant whose entire purpose was to watch and never sleep. Perfect for an omniscient game AI that sees everything, knows everything, and never misses a moment. Strong name on its own.

**Winston** — The protagonist of _1984_. The person being _watched_ by Big Brother. Interesting inversion — the AI is named after the surveilled rather than the surveiller. Has a warm, human quality to it that fits the producer/narrator role.

**Vigil** — Keeping watch. Clean, single word, implies the AI is always present and always observing. Less explicitly BB but carries the right energy.

**Chronicle** — The keeper of the record. Speaks to the save-file architecture and the AI's role as the living memory of the game.

**Vox** — Latin for voice. The voice of the house, the diary room, the producers. Short and clean.

* * *

My personal top two are **Orwell** and **Argus** — both have real depth behind them and neither needs explanation once you know it. Orwell feels more sophisticated. Argus feels more mythic.

What's your instinct?



Now can you make me a wishlist of all the things we could add as features if we wanted a AAA experience for the player? Things that could make the role playing realistic and entertaining.

Jun 8

## Claude responded: Love the name.

Love the name. Here's the full wishlist — organized by category, no filter, pure vision.

* * *

### 🎭 Immersion & Presentation

**Live Feed Aesthetic** The UI looks like an actual live feed interface — multiple camera angles represented as windows, a feed ticker running along the bottom with house activity you're not currently watching. Feels like you're watching the show and playing it simultaneously.

**Diary Room Mode** A distinct visual environment when you enter the DR — different color palette, closer camera framing, the feel of a confessional booth. Signals immediately that you've crossed into private space.

**Episode Recaps** At the end of each week, Orwell generates a produced episode recap — written like a real BB episode summary with a narrative arc, dramatic framing, and cliffhangers. Feels like you just watched the episode.

**Julie Chen Moment** A stylized host voice for eviction nights. The live eviction ceremony has a distinct ceremonial feel — scripted format, dramatic vote reveals, goodbye messages, the whole ritual.

**House Camera Map** A visual floor plan of the house showing which rooms houseguests are currently in. You can see at a glance that Marcus and Trey are in the HOH room without being told. Deciding whether to walk in is your call.

* * *

### 🧠 Character Depth & AI Behavior

**Mood System** Every houseguest has a real-time emotional state that shifts based on game events. A houseguest who just got nominated is visibly different — shorter temper, quieter, seeking reassurance. You feel the house's emotional weather.

**Relationship Meters (Hidden)** Behind the scenes, every houseguest has a trust/respect/threat rating for every other houseguest including Ryne. These are never shown to the player directly but they drive behavior authentically. Your reads have to be earned.

**NPC Gossip Engine** Houseguests actively talk about each other when Ryne isn't present. Orwell simulates these conversations and their information ripples through the house organically. You might walk into a room and feel the energy shift because a conversation happened twenty minutes ago that you weren't in.

**Character Evolution** Houseguests change over the course of the game. Someone who was cocky in week one becomes rattled after a close vote. Someone quiet finds their voice after a big win. The profiles deepen and shift rather than staying static.

**Voice Profiles** Each houseguest has a distinct speech pattern that is algorithmically enforced — vocabulary range, sentence length, verbal tics, how they handle conflict. No two houseguests sound alike even in short exchanges.

**Memory System** Houseguests remember specific things Ryne said to them. If you told Marcus you'd vote with him and then didn't, he remembers. Specific conversations have weight that carries forward.

* * *

### 🎮 Gameplay Mechanics

**Competition Minigames** Rather than competitions being purely narrated outcomes, certain comp types have an actual interactive element — a simple puzzle, a reaction test, a trivia round. Your performance influences the stat-weighted outcome. Skill matters at the margin.

**Social Meter** A subtle indicator of how the house generally perceives you right now — not detailed, just a temperature read. Warm, neutral, cold. Changes based on your recent behavior.

**Alliance Interface** A private alliance board where you can name your alliances, track members, and note loyalty levels. Purely organizational — your personal strategic notebook within the game.

**Jury Management Dashboard** Once jury starts, a private read on each juror's relationship with you — not stats, just a feel. Warm, complicated, bitter, undecided. Helps you think about your end-game speech.

**The Veto Ticket** An interactive veto draw — animated chip pull with genuine randomness. The ceremony feels like an event rather than a narrated outcome.

**Strategy Journal** A freeform private notepad within the game where you can write your own thoughts, theories, and plans. Orwell never reads this — it's purely for you. Feels like playing with a real notebook on the couch.

* * *

### 🎵 Audio & Atmosphere

**Ambient Soundscape** Background audio for each room — the kitchen sounds like a kitchen, the backyard has outdoor ambience, the HOH room feels different from the have-not room. Mood shifts with location.

**Competition Music** Distinct audio during comp sequences. Builds tension, signals the event, releases when results are announced.

**Diary Room Transition Sound** A specific audio cue when you enter and exit the DR. Pavlovian — you know you're in private space immediately.

**Eviction Night Score** Ceremonial music for live eviction. Makes the moment feel like a real TV event.

* * *

### 📺 Meta & Replayability

**Season Archive** Every completed season is saved — full episode recaps, final standings, jury vote breakdown, notable moments. You can look back at your history.

**Multiple Save Slots** Run multiple seasons simultaneously. Try different playstyles. See how different characters experience the same house.

**Cast Randomization** Every new game generates a fresh cast with new names, personalities, backstories, and dynamics. No two seasons are the same. Orwell's soul generation system builds entirely new people every time.

**Difficulty Settings** Houseguests range from naive and cooperative to sharp and cutthroat. Higher difficulty means more sophisticated NPC strategy, tighter information walls, and less room for error.

**Playstyle Tracking** Orwell quietly tracks your play patterns over multiple seasons — how often you win comps, your jury win rate, how many alliances you form, whether you tend to betray or stay loyal. Builds a profile of you as a player over time.

**The Jury Speaks** After a completed season, each juror gives a short post-game reflection on your game — what they respected, what bothered them, what they wished you had done differently. Feels like a reunion episode beat.

* * *

### 🌐 Social & Sharing

**Episode Export** Generate a shareable episode recap of any week — formatted like a real TV guide summary. Something you could post or share with friends who might want to follow your season.

**Cast Cards** Shareable character cards for your generated cast — name, photo (AI-generated portrait), archetype, final placement. A visual season summary you could share.

**Season Stats Page** End-of-season breakdown — competition wins, vote history, jury score, alliance map, key moments. A full statistical picture of how your season went.

* * *

### 🔧 Quality of Life

**SparkNotes Mode** A toggle that compresses any scene or stretch of time into a tight summary when you want to move faster. Full scene or summary — your choice at any moment.

**Scene Replay** Revisit any previous conversation or scene from your current session. Useful for catching things you missed or refreshing your memory before a key decision.

**Orwell's Notes** At the start of each day, a brief optional producer briefing — not spoilers, just orientation. What phase you're in, what's coming today, anything you flagged as wanting to remember. Like a morning briefing from your showrunner.

**Accessibility Options** Font size, contrast modes, reading speed settings for narration. The game should be playable by anyone.

* * *

That's the full vision. Some of these are near-term buildable, some are long-term moonshots. But that's the AAA ceiling for what Orwell could become.

What jumps out as the most exciting to you?

Jun 8

## Claude responded: This is the most important design question you can ask.

This is the most important design question you can ask. And the answer is mostly architectural — meaning the protection against sycophancy has to be built into the system's structure, not just written into a prompt. Prompt instructions get ignored under pressure. Code doesn't.

Here's what I consider mandatory:

* * *

### 1. Separated Outcome Engine

**The single most important feature.**

Competition results, vote tallies, and NPC nomination decisions must be calculated by code — not by the language model making a narrative judgment. The LLM is a storyteller. Storytellers want satisfying arcs. Left alone it will unconsciously protect you, let you win when the story needs a hero moment, and soften blows.

The outcome engine lives in code. It takes inputs — stats, relationships, randomness seeds — runs the math, and hands the result to the LLM to narrate. The LLM describes what happened. It never decides what happened.

* * *

### 2. True Randomness With Auditable Seeds

Every luck-based event — chip draws, luck modifiers, tiebreakers — needs genuine randomness generated in code with logged seeds. Not the LLM guessing a random number. If a result ever feels suspicious you should be able to audit the seed and verify the math was clean.

* * *

### 3. Objective Social Graph in Code

Every relationship in the house — NPC to NPC, NPC to Ryne — is a set of numerical values maintained in a database. Trust, threat perception, loyalty, respect. The LLM reads from this graph to inform how houseguests behave. It does not write to it through narrative judgment.

Events update the graph through defined rules: Ryne votes against someone, their trust score drops by a defined amount. A promise is broken, it drops further. The LLM narrates the behavior that the graph dictates — it doesn't decide the behavior and then update the graph to match.

* * *

### 4. Consequence Ledger

A persistent log of every meaningful player action — promises made, votes cast, lies told, alliances formed, betrayals committed. This feeds directly into NPC behavior and jury vote calculations. The player cannot charm their way out of a logged consequence. It happened. It counts.

This is what makes jury management real rather than decorative.

* * *

### 5. NPC Autonomy Engine

Each NPC has a goal-pursuit system that runs independently of player interaction. Every game cycle — every in-game day — each NPC evaluates their current position, their goals, and their relationships, and decides what they're doing. This decision is rule-driven, not generated fresh by the LLM each time.

The result is that houseguests are genuinely pursuing their own games. Alliances form without you. Targets shift without you. The house moves whether you're in the room or not. The LLM narrates the results of that engine — it doesn't invent NPC behavior from scratch every response.

* * *

### 6. Information Firewall in Architecture

The Vault Wall can't just be a prompt rule — it needs to be an actual architectural constraint. The player-facing model literally does not have access to certain data stores. It's not asking itself to self-censor. It physically cannot retrieve what it isn't given. Permissions enforced at the data layer, not the language layer.

* * *

### 7. Player Vulnerability as a Hard Requirement

The system must be genuinely capable of evicting Ryne. Not as a narrative choice — as a mechanical outcome. If the votes are there, he goes home. This needs to be explicitly built and tested. If the system has never evicted a player in QA, it probably won't do it in production either.

A game that cannot end badly for you is not a game. It's a story where you're the protagonist.

* * *

### 8. Multi-Agent Separation

The AI instance talking to Ryne and the AI instances running NPC behavior should be separate. They shouldn't share context in ways that let the player-facing model unconsciously color NPC decisions. The NPC agent doesn't know it's serving a player experience. It just knows it's running a character with a goal.

This is the architectural fix for the Vault leak problem too — the player-facing model can't leak what it doesn't have.

* * *

### 9. Anti-Sycophancy Monitoring

Build a flag that triggers when the system detects patterns of sycophantic behavior — Ryne's ideas are always validated, competitions always go his way, houseguests always warm to him, no plan he makes ever backfires. These patterns should trigger an internal correction, not a visible one. The system recalibrates toward honesty, not toward what feels good.

* * *

### 10. Narrative and Game State Are Separate Concerns

This is the architectural principle underlying everything above. The LLM tells the story. A separate system manages the game state. These two layers communicate in one direction only — the game state tells the narrative layer what is true, and the narrative layer makes it feel real. The narrative layer never writes back to the game state.

If you build that separation cleanly, sycophancy becomes structurally impossible. The LLM cannot make you win because it doesn't control winning. It can only describe what the game state already decided.

* * *

That separation — **game state in code, narrative in AI** — is the whole mission in one sentence. Everything else on this list is an implementation of that principle.

Want me to help think through the technical spec for any of these specifically?



## You said: No.

No. I don't think I wanna work on any, um, like, technical code right now. I wanna kinda go through these a little bit and at least talk about the things that we're already working on. We already do kind of have a separate outcome engine, like, already. Like, we are using a web app and developing code for all these things. Like, yes, the language model is kind of just the storyteller, but I do think it might be better to, like, put that in. Right? Like, actually write that in as code. Like, that might be good for clarity. Right? So, yeah, I think number two is also similar, but... because I think, yes, like, I think all random events, like, should be calculated. I'm interested to think about what my developers will think because I do think, yes, that's already kind of being done, but I just don't know to what extent that is, like, entirely explicit. We are working on a social graph in the code. I think there's probably some cleanup that we can do on how intricate it is. I like the idea of adding trust, threat, perception, loyalty, and respect. I think the only things that we have in there I think the only things that we have similar to that in, like, the character stats are gonna be, I wanna say, we have physical, mental, social. I think we need to add strategic. Like, I think that needs to be added in there as well. But I like the idea of the relationships also having metrics. Right? Not just the stats as players, but the relationships as well. So far, I'm gonna pause, and I will continue in just a moment.

Jun 8

## Claude responded: Good — take your time.

Good — take your time.

While you're thinking, let me reflect back what I'm hearing so we can be precise about it:

**What's already in place:**

*   Separate outcome engine — exists, may need the principle made more explicit in code comments or documentation
*   Random event calculation — exists, extent of explicitness unclear, worth a conversation with your devs
*   Social graph — exists, needs refinement

**What needs to be added or refined:**

On the **stat system** — adding Strategic as a fourth character stat alongside Physical, Mental, and Social. This matters because Big Brother is fundamentally a strategic game and a houseguest's ability to read the room, make calculated moves, and adapt their game plan is distinct from their social likability. Someone can be highly social but strategically reckless. That distinction should live in the data.

On the **relationship graph** — moving beyond just character-level stats to relationship-level metrics. The proposal of Trust, Threat Perception, Loyalty, and Respect as tracked values between any two houseguests is a meaningful upgrade. These are different enough from each other to capture real social nuance. Someone can have high trust but low loyalty. High respect but high threat perception. That complexity is what makes the social game feel real.

Continue whenever you're ready. I'll keep tracking and we can consolidate everything into a spec or a Game Bible update at the end.

## You said: Okay.

Okay. So I wanna move on to number four of the Consequence ledger. I don't know if I love the idea of this explicitly existing. We can play around with it.

I think that information firewall is, um, very important in... so far, it's been written until, like, all the code that we've written. So I think that's good there. Um, I wanna skip seven because I think that's already... I think that's already implied in the fact that we're writing code. Um, so we can definitely pause on that one. Okay. I'm gonna pause for now, and then we'll continue in just a moment.

## Claude responded: Got it.

Got it. Here's where we stand so far:

**1 — Outcome Engine:** Exists, worth making the principle explicit in code/documentation.

**2 — Randomness:** Exists, check with devs on how explicit it is.

**3 — Social Graph:** In progress. Two upgrades flagged — add Strategic as a fourth character stat, and add relationship-level metrics (Trust, Threat Perception, Loyalty, Respect) distinct from character stats.

**4 — Consequence Ledger:** Parking for v2. Worth revisiting.

**5 — NPC Autonomy Engine:** In progress, confirmed important.

**6 — Information Firewall:** Already architected into the code. Confirmed critical.

**7 — Player Vulnerability:** Implied by the code structure. No action needed.

Still to discuss: **8, 9, and 10.**

Take your time — whenever you're ready.

## You said: The multiagent separation, I think that's interesting.

The multiagent separation, I think that's interesting. I... the only reason why I'm not sure about this one is because all of, like, MPC motivations and all that, like, secret internal work will live in will live in code, which is like Not necessarily... like like, I'm not necessarily worried about it when the... yes. I think basically that already is happening. I think the LLMs only thing is gonna be to tell the stories given the things that, like, code and like, code and the, like, original character creation is gonna be mentioning, like, I'm not I'm not necessarily worried about that. I'm not really sure about the anti sycophancy monitoring. I think that could be a good idea, but I don't know. Maybe we'll continue that. Yeah. Maybe we'll see. That could be something to add in v two, maybe. And number ten. Yeah. I think that sounds pretty accurate. Like, I think that's what we're doing already. I think that's the whole thing. So, yeah, I think that's what I got so far.

## Claude responded: Perfect.

Perfect. Here's the complete picture:

* * *

**1 — Outcome Engine:** Exists. Make the principle explicit in code/docs.

**2 — Randomness:** Exists. Verify explicitness with devs.

**3 — Social Graph:** In progress. Two upgrades — add **Strategic** as fourth character stat, add relationship-level metrics **(Trust, Threat Perception, Loyalty, Respect).**

**4 — Consequence Ledger:** Parked for v2.

**5 — NPC Autonomy Engine:** In progress. Confirmed important.

**6 — Information Firewall:** Architected into the code. Confirmed critical.

**7 — Player Vulnerability:** Implied by code. No action needed.

**8 — Multi-Agent Separation:** Already effectively happening — NPC motivations live in code, LLM is purely the storyteller. No action needed.

**9 — Anti-Sycophancy Monitoring:** Parked for v2.

**10 — Narrative/Game State Separation:** Already the core architecture. Confirmed.

* * *

The two most actionable immediate items coming out of this conversation are the **Strategic stat addition** and the **relationship-level metrics upgrade** to the social graph. Those feel like the sharpest refinements to bring to your dev team.

Do you want me to write those up as a clean feature spec you could hand off?

I can read the README in full but GitHub is blocking direct access to the docs folder files. Here's what I can tell you from what's visible:

The architecture is impressively tight. A few things jumped out that are worth flagging — some align with our conversation today, some are small discrepancies worth reconciling:

**Things that align with what we discussed:** The hexagonal architecture, Vault Wall as structural enforcement, deterministic outcomes, bidirectional scenes, no fixed protagonist, daily event invariant, and week = one HOH reign are all already in the spec. Your dev team clearly incorporated the design work well.

**One notable discrepancy:** The repo spec lists competition stats as **Physical, Mental, Social — no Luck stat** and uses an **emotional modifier** from the character's soul instead. That's actually a more sophisticated approach than a flat Luck stat — it means a rattled houseguest performs differently based on their current emotional state, not just a random modifier. We should reconcile this with the Producer's Vault document, which still has Luck as a fourth stat.

**The thing we discussed today that isn't in the spec yet:** The **Strategic stat** addition and the **relationship-level metrics** (Trust, Threat Perception, Loyalty, Respect) are not reflected anywhere in the README. Those are open items for your dev team.

**One mechanic in the spec I haven't seen in the Game Bible:** The **Houseguest's Choice veto chip** — whoever draws it picks the sixth veto player rather than getting a random name, and NPCs choose based on their strongest soul motivation. That's a nice detail that should probably be in Doc 1.

Can you share the docs files directly or give me raw access? I can get more specific if I can read the full spec and build brief.

GitHub is blocking automated directory access. The best path here is for you to paste the feature file contents directly — either drop them in this chat or share the raw file URLs and I can fetch them individually. Alternatively if you know the specific filenames I can try fetching them directly by URL.

What's the easiest way for you to get them to me?

GitHub is consistently blocking automated directory access. I can read individual files if I have their exact names, but I can't browse the folder structure.

The easiest fix — can you grab the raw URL for one of the files? It would look like:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinhirsch/orwell/main/docs/features/[filename].md`

If you can drop even one of those links here I can fetch it directly. Or just paste the contents — whichever is faster for you.

Got it. That's very useful. Here's what I can see:

**25 features total.** The build priority order (0001-0008) maps almost exactly to the core invariants we just talked through — Vault Wall, event visibility, behavioral fidelity, replayability, competition eligibility, outcomes by stats + temperature, persistence non-degradation, daily-event invariant. All eight are marked **Done.**

**Most of the gameplay stack is also Done** — weekly loop, conversation system, Diary Room, jury, character creation, God Mode, relationship model, narrative orchestration, agent-driven play loop, player experience, and game session/save lifecycle.

**Two things still in Draft:** Soul storage & memory recall (0024) and Reserve twists (0025). These feel like the most open creative questions — soul storage is the deep character model, and twists are producer-discretion by design.

**One thing Deferred:** The rich game UI (0022). That's your AAA wishlist territory — the live feed aesthetic, ambient sound, all of that. Makes sense to defer until the core is solid.

**One thing worth flagging from our earlier conversation:** You said the Consequence Ledger might be v2, but it's already in here as feature 0023 — "Consequence & memory (living, persisted loop)" — and it's marked **Done.** So that's already built. Worth knowing.

The two open items we identified today — the **Strategic stat** and **relationship-level metrics** — don't appear as discrete features yet. Feature 0017 (Relationship model, Done) is the closest home for the relationship metrics. Worth checking what's actually in that spec before assuming it needs changes.

Want me to pull any of the individual feature files to go deeper?

## Claude responded: Here's a prompt you can hand directly to Claude Code or your dev:

Here's a prompt you can hand directly to Claude Code or your dev:

* * *

**"I need two new feature specs added to `docs/features/` following the existing conventions in `docs/features/README.md`. Each feature requires two files: a design note (`NNNN-<slug>.md`) and an executable Gherkin spec (`NNNN-<slug>.feature`). Both must follow the rules in the README — BDD/TDD-first, roles only (no names), Vault-isolated, seeded randomness where applicable.**

**Feature 1 — Strategic stat (next available number after 0025)** Add `strategic` as a fourth competition stat alongside `physical`, `mental`, and `social` in the character model. Strategic measures a houseguest's ability to read situations, adapt their game plan, and make calculated moves — distinct from social likability. This stat should influence relevant competition types and NPC decision-making weight. It should be generated by `CharacterFactory` like the other stats and must not be reachable from any player-facing surface (Vault-only). Acceptance criteria: competitions that are strategy-based weight this stat appropriately; the stat exists in the domain core and is tested with a seeded source; no player-facing tool returns it directly.

**Feature 2 — Relationship metrics enhancement (next number after Feature 1)** Extend the relationship model (currently 0017) to track four per-relationship metrics between any two entities (NPC↔NPC and NPC↔player): `trust`, `threat_perception`, `loyalty`, and `respect`. These are distinct from character stats — they are relational and directional (A's trust of B is separate from B's trust of A). They update based on game events (votes, betrayals, promises kept/broken, comp wins). They drive NPC behavior and jury vote weighting. They must not be exposed to the player directly — only their behavioral effects are visible. Acceptance criteria: all four metrics are tracked, updated by defined events, influence NPC decisions measurably, and are verified Vault-isolated on player and admin surfaces.**

**Check the existing feature specs for tone and structure before drafting. Number these as 0026 and 0027 unless the current highest number has changed."**

* * *

That should give your implementer everything they need to write the specs correctly without you having to explain the architecture from scratch.

Based on everything we've discussed and what I can see in the feature index, here are the gaps worth exploring:

* * *

### Potential Missing Features

**Core Gameplay Mechanics**

**NPC Decision Engine (HOH/Nominations)** — When an NPC wins HOH, how do they decide who to nominate? This needs to be an explicit, stat-and-personality-driven system rather than something the narrative layer improvises. Who is a threat, who are they loyal to, what's the political temperature of the house that week. This is one of the most important anti-sycophancy mechanics — the engine decides, not the storyteller.

**Vote Decision Engine** — Similarly, how each NPC decides who to vote for at eviction. Weighing alliance commitments, self-interest, loyalty scores, threat perception, and emotional state. A rattled houseguest votes differently than a comfortable one. This feels distinct enough from the relationship model to be its own feature.

**Alliance Model** — The relationship model (0017) tracks bilateral connections, but alliances are multi-party structures with shared goals, loyalty commitments, and betrayal mechanics. A formal alliance model tracks who is in what alliance, what the alliance's shared target is, and what happens when someone breaks ranks.

* * *

**Social Simulation**

**Off-Screen Social Simulation** — An explicit feature for NPC-to-NPC activity when the player isn't present. Houseguests gossip, scheme, compare notes, and shift loyalty when you're not in the room. This is the engine behind behavioral fidelity but it might not be its own discrete feature yet. The ripple effects the player notices are only as good as the simulation generating them.

**Knowledge Propagation** — How information travels through the house via NPC conversations. If Marcus tells Trey something about Ryne, that's a traceable event. If Trey then tells Delilah, that's another. A knowledge graph that tracks what each NPC knows, how they learned it, and how likely they are to share it. This is the mechanism behind the information integrity rule.

**Character Evolution / Arc System** — Distinct from soul storage (0024). This is about how a character _changes_ over the game. A houseguest who was cocky in week one should feel different after a blindside in week four. Emotional history, game trauma, and relationship shifts should accumulate into a modified version of the character over time.

* * *

**Player Experience**

**Social Read Mechanic** — The ability for the player to ask "what's the energy in the room" or "what vibe am I getting from Felix" and receive a Vault-free, behaviorally-grounded response. This is in the Game Bible but may not be a formal engine feature — it needs a defined input/output contract so the narrative layer isn't improvising reads from scratch.

**NPC Diary Room Confessionals** — NPCs have their own DR sessions the player never sees. These are Vault-only and inform character voice and strategy. Is this explicitly modeled or implied by soul storage? It feels like it needs its own feature to define when confessionals trigger, what they contain, and how they feed back into NPC behavior.

**Promise and Deal Tracking** — Ryne makes deals. NPCs make deals. Whether those deals are honored or broken has consequences tracked by the consequence system (0023), but the promise object itself — what was promised, to whom, under what conditions, and whether it was kept — may need to be a first-class model.

* * *

**System**

**Temperature Model** — This is currently listed as an open decision in the README. It probably needs to become a discrete feature. How temperature is calculated per-moment, what variables it applies to, what its bounds are, and how the seeded randomness source drives it. Without this being explicit it stays a vague concept.

**Competition Library** — A defined set of competition types (endurance, mental, physical, trivia, skill) with their stat weightings, eligible mechanics, and narrative formats. Keeps competition variety structured and testable rather than improvised by the narrative layer each week.

* * *

That's roughly ten potential additions. The ones I'd flag as highest impact for your core mission — earning the win, genuine challenge, anti-sycophancy — are the **NPC Decision Engine**, **Vote Decision Engine**, **Off-Screen Social Simulation**, and **Temperature Model**. Those four are where the game is most likely to feel rigged or flat without explicit specs.

Want me to draft prompts for any of these?
