Feature: NPC-initiated deal offers

  Today the player proposes deals and NPCs deal with each other, but no houseguest ever comes to the
  player. This adds that pathway: a motivated houseguest pulls the player aside with a deal, grounded in
  their real read. Accepting makes a real deal; declining cools them. Everything stays Vault-safe and the
  engine supplies the offer's shape — the narrator never invents it.

  Scenario: A motivated houseguest floats the player a deal at a lull
    Given a live game with houseguest deal offers enabled
    When the season plays through several lulls
    Then a houseguest floats the player a deal offer
    And the floated offer names who it is from, its kind, and its terms

  Scenario: The floated offer's kind is grounded in the NPC's real read
    Given a live game where one houseguest reads the player as a strong ally
    When that ally floats the player a deal offer
    Then the floated offer is a final-two deal, grounded in their real bond

  Scenario: Accepting a floated offer makes a real player deal
    Given a houseguest has floated the player a deal offer
    When the player accepts the floated offer
    Then a deal between the player and that houseguest stands on the board
    And no floated offer is left waiting

  Scenario: Declining a floated offer rebuffs the houseguest
    Given a houseguest has floated the player a deal offer
    When the player declines the floated offer
    Then no deal is created from the floated offer
    And that houseguest's hidden read of the player cools a little

  Scenario: Floated offers are player-witnessed, Vault-safe, and bounded
    Given a houseguest has floated the player a deal offer
    When the player-facing surfaces are read for the floated offer
    Then the floated offer is the player's own knowledge, never hidden Vault content
    And only one floated offer stands at a time

  Scenario: With offers off, no houseguest floats a deal
    Given a live game with houseguest deal offers disabled
    When the season plays through several lulls
    Then no houseguest ever floats the player a deal offer
