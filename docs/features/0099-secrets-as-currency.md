# 0099 — Secrets as a tradeable currency (information becomes diplomacy)

> **Status:** 🟢 **PO REVIEW RESOLVED (owner, 2026-06-27) — BUILD-READY.** Build TOGETHER with 0093 (#862) as one *secrets-as-power* mechanic (leverage / expose / **trade**); **deception + player bluff first-class**. See § "PO review" + `docs/decisions/PO-DECISIONS-LOG.md` (2026-06-27) + #880.

## Why — the gap this closes

0093 makes a *learned* secret a **lever** the player can wield against its **subject** — leverage in a
deal with that person, or an expose that damages them. That is the *vertical* use of information:
pressure on the one it's about. It leaves the *horizontal* use untouched — the most _Big Brother_ thing
information does: **you trade it.** You tell an ally what you overheard so they'll vote your way; you
sell a name for a name; you barter a juicy secret to a third party for safety, a comp throw, or a slot
in their final-two. The secret you hold is rarely *about* the person you want something from — its value
is precisely that you can **give it away** to someone who wants it.

Today none of that exists as a mechanic. The player can *learn* secrets (0075/0002) and, with 0093, can
*use one against its subject*. But information has **no exchange value**: there is no way to hand a held
secret to another houseguest *as consideration* for a concession, and NPCs do not barter secrets with
each other in the hidden layer. Information is an asset you can spend *on its subject* (0093) but never
**trade** to a third party. This feature adds the trade layer — a thin economy over the existing
knowledge-facts + relationship + deal machinery — so information becomes **diplomacy**: alliances of
convenience, double-crosses, and the irony of a secret you sold coming back around.

### Retention / "why an information economy makes a returning player keep playing"

0093's retention argument was *a learned secret is a bankable asset you can cash in on its subject.* 0099
multiplies that: a held secret is now **liquid** — spendable on *anyone who wants it*, not just the one
it's about. That turns information-gathering from a single-payoff act into a portfolio the player manages
across a whole season: *who wants what I know, and what will they give me for it?* It is the loop that
rewards the patient, social, eavesdropping style _BB_ rewards, and it deepens the 0023 "the house
remembers" promise from the player's side — **you** remember what you traded, to whom, and the
double-cross it set up three weeks later. An economy of secrets is a reason to keep playing the long game,
not just to collect atmosphere.

## The core idea — a held secret is *consideration* a third party will pay for

Two symmetric halves, both riding existing machinery:

### 1. The player trades a held secret to a third party for a concession (the player-driven half)

A `KnowledgeFact` the player **already holds** (any real fact in `KnowledgeService.knownTo(player)` —
about a houseguest, an off-screen scene the player learned, an overheard plan) can be **offered to a
*recipient* houseguest as consideration** for a concession the player wants from *them*. The trade is a
two-sided exchange: *give X to get Y.*

- **What the player gives:** a specific held `factId` (or, symmetrically, a concession of their own — a
  vote, safety, a comp throw — but the *novel* currency this feature adds is the **secret**).
- **What the player asks for:** a concession from the recipient — most naturally **a deal** (0039:
  safety, a vote, a final-two, target-someone-else), but also a one-off (a comp throw, a piece of intel
  in return — a *secret-for-secret* swap).
- **How the engine resolves it:** the **value of the offered secret to *this recipient*** (a bounded,
  seeded `tradeValue`, below) colors how likely the recipient is to **accept** the exchange and, when the
  ask is a deal, how likely they are to **honor** it — *exactly* the way 0093's `leverage` colors a deal.
  The recipient can always **refuse** (the secret may be worthless to them, or they may distrust the
  player); a bad trade can even *cost* the player standing (peddling gossip reads as untrustworthy to
  some archetypes). It is barter, not a vending machine.

The crux that distinguishes this from 0093: in 0093 the secret's power is **over its subject**; here the
secret's power is **to a recipient who is not its subject** — its value is *what that recipient would do
with it* (a rival's secret is worth a lot to that rival's enemy; worthless to that rival's ally). The
engine computes `tradeValue(fact, recipient)` from the **recipient's own reads** of the secret's subject
(do they want leverage on them? are they threatened by them?) — perspective-bound, never omniscient.

### 2. NPCs barter secrets with each other, hidden (the off-screen half)

In the hidden layer, NPCs **trade secrets among themselves** as part of their off-screen scheming: a
houseguest who holds a juicy fact about a rival *spends* it with an ally to cement a bond or buy a vote,
exactly as a human player would. This is **not a new disclosure path** — it is the existing 0038/0094
gossip diffusion **given a motive and a price**: today a hidden fact diffuses NPC→NPC somewhat
mechanically (along the social graph, distorting); 0099 lets a *trade* be one driver of that diffusion (an
NPC chooses to pass a fact *because* it buys them something), and records the resulting **relationship
fold** (the recipient owes the giver; a bond firms). The trade itself, its price, and the magnitudes are
**Vault-only**, surfacing to the player only if a pathway later terminates at them (overhear, an NPC tells
them, the recipient weaponizes it in a scene the player witnesses), at which point it becomes the player's
knowledge exactly as any surfaced fact does (0002).

> The NPC↔NPC barter makes the house's information economy *feel real* from the outside: secrets visibly
> move (a houseguest suddenly knows something they shouldn't, a bond firms for no public reason the player
> can see), and the player can be *outmaneuvered* in the economy — someone trades a secret about the
> player before the player can spend it first. It is the same "off-screen NPC-to-NPC scheming the player
> never witnesses" the #1 mandate demands, applied to information as currency.

### What stays exactly as-is (so this is additive, not a rewrite)

- **Learning a secret is unchanged.** 0099 adds **no** new way to learn secrets — it consumes what
  0075/0002 already record (player side) and rides 0038/0094 diffusion (NPC side). No new disclosure
  path, no new Vault read.
- **Deals are the host, unchanged in shape.** A traded-for concession is, in the common case, a 0039
  `Deal`; the offered secret rides *alongside* `makeDeal` as an optional consideration — with no secret
  offered, deal formation is **byte-identical** to 0039 / 0093. (See R4.)
- **The relationship/jury folds are reused** (0026 trust/affinity/threat moves, the betrayal-shock for a
  trade that backfires, 0014 jury demerits). A trade's consequence is the *existing* folds applied from a
  new trigger — no new hidden authoring.
- **0093's lever family is reused, not duplicated.** 0099 adds a *trade* use of a held secret on top of
  0093's *leverage*/*expose* uses; they share the `usedAs` marker, the season cap pattern, the `factId`
  ownership check, and the `LEVERAGE`/`SECRET_TRADE` constants sibling. (See R2 — likely one build spec.)

## The mechanic (ports / modules — Definition of Ready, pending the PO rulings)

> Exact signatures firm up at build after R1–R4. Sketch only, to prove hexagonal fit. These are **model
> levers**, engine-decided — like `confide` / `makeDeal` / `exposeSecret`, **not** FE-driven write-backs —
> so the four-place FE-write-back wiring discipline does not apply. **If built with 0093, these land in the
> same modules** (`leverage.ts` / `leverageConstants.ts`), not new files.

- **`src/engine/secretTrade.ts`** *(pure, no I/O, no Vault handle — likely folded into 0093's `leverage.ts`)* —
  the decision core:
  - `tradeValue(fact, recipientRead, subjectRead, rng) → number` — a bounded, seeded factor in `[0,1]`:
    how much the **recipient** values this secret, from *already-read* signals — the secret's **severity
    class** (the public `kind` of the underlying `HiddenElement`, never its text — the 0075/0093 class
    gloss), how much the recipient **wants leverage on / is threatened by the secret's subject** (the
    recipient's *own* directed edges toward the subject, 0026), and the recipient's read of the player
    (a recipient who distrusts the player discounts the offer). A secret about someone the recipient
    doesn't care about has near-zero value. **No raw number ever crosses to the player.**
  - `tradeOutcome(fact, recipient, ask, rng) → { accepted, recipientFold, traderBacklash?, ... }` — the
    bounded, seeded resolution: whether the recipient takes the trade, the relationship fold it produces
    (the recipient warms / owes the giver), and any backlash on the trader (peddling can read as
    untrustworthy). Pure; the adapter delivers folds through the 0039 `ReconcileSink` pattern.
  - `npcBarterStep(holder, candidateRecipients, board, rng) → BarterMove?` *(hidden half)* — the
    perspective-bound, seeded choice of whether a holder *spends* a held fact with a recipient to buy a
    bond/vote; returns the chosen `factId` + recipient + the fold, **Vault-only**. This is a **driver of**
    the existing 0038/0094 diffusion (motive + price), not a second diffusion engine.
- **`src/engine/secretTradeConstants.ts`** *(likely folded into `leverageConstants.ts`)* — the single
  tunable `SECRET_TRADE` module (severity → value weights, the trade-to-deal factor cap, the
  backlash bands, the per-season trade cap, the NPC-barter rate). The `CONFIDENCE` / `LEVERAGE` /
  `DEAL_IMPACTS` sibling; the B59 grep gate covers it.
- **`GameSessionAdapter`:**
  - `makeDeal` (0039) gains an **optional, Vault-free `tradedSecret` descriptor** — a *reference* to a
    `factId` the player already holds, offered to the **recipient** (a third party, not necessarily the
    secret's subject) as consideration. Validated against `KnowledgeService.knownTo(player)` (the player
    can only trade what they actually learned). The engine computes `tradeValue` and folds it into the
    (bounded, seeded) formation/honoring likelihood. Absent ⇒ 0039/0093 unchanged. *(This is the
    recommended R4 shape: 0099 is leverage's sibling option on the same `makeDeal`, differing only in
    that the secret is valued **to the recipient**, not **over the subject**.)*
  - optionally a new action **`tradeSecret(factId, toNpcId, askKind, terms)`** on the `GameSession` port /
    `PLAYER_TOOLS` for a *secret-for-X* swap that is **not** a standing deal (e.g. a one-off comp throw, a
    secret-for-secret exchange): validates the `factId` is the player's own knowledge, resolves
    `tradeOutcome`, folds the relationship change (0026), **records the trade as a witnessed event** (0002
    — the recipient now *knows* the traded fact via `surfaceInformationTo`, with lineage), increments the
    season trade cap, and returns `{ accepted, narratable, ... }` — **no number**, only what the model may
    voice. Single authority, like `runCompetition` / `confide` / `makeDeal` / `exposeSecret`. *(Whether
    this is a distinct lever or just `makeDeal` with `tradedSecret` is an R4 sub-call.)*
  - `campaignTick` / the off-screen society tick (0038) calls `npcBarterStep` for active holders (behind
    the same off-screen flag the society already runs under), folding the hidden bond and recording the
    NPC→NPC knowledge transfer in the **Vault** — surfacing to the player only via the existing pathways
    (0002/0094). On the dedicated side-rng ⇒ calibration byte-identical when off.
- **`src/engine/momentPrompts.ts`** — the social moment + the lever manifest gain the `makeDeal`
  `tradedSecret` option (and `tradeSecret` if a distinct lever): *when* to call them (the player is
  offering something they know in exchange for something they want), that the **engine decides whether the
  recipient bites and how the relationship moves**, and **never invent a trade outcome the lever didn't
  return**. The value is voiced as texture ("they'd kill to know that"), never as a number.

## ADR 0005 — magnitude vs. shape (the anti-sycophancy spine)

This feature lives squarely on ADR 0005's line and must not cross it (identical discipline to 0093):

- **Open set (the model proposes shape).** *Which* secret is being traded, *to whom*, *for what* (the ask),
  and the *prose* of the negotiation — the model's to interpret and voice, as rich as the player's play.
  The free-text content rides through unchanged (lossless); the NPC↔NPC barter's *flavor* is the model's
  when it later surfaces in a scene.
- **Closed set (the engine owns magnitude).** *How much* a traded secret is worth to a recipient, *how
  far* it moves a deal's accept/honor likelihood, *how hard* a backfire bites, and *which* hidden bond an
  NPC barter firms — all **bounded, seeded, engine-owned**. The model never proposes an amount; a held
  secret can never be *pumped* to force a yes (mandate #3). With no `tradedSecret`/`tradeSecret`/barter
  invoked, every existing fold is **byte-identical** — the `expressiveNonCollapse` gate stays the proof
  the open set isn't being normalized.

## The Vault Wall (player AND admin) — why this is safe

A "trade" looks, at a glance, like the player wielding secret state across the house. It does not breach
the Wall, for the same structural reasons 0075/0093 don't:

1. **The player only ever trades a secret they ALREADY legitimately learned.** The trade operates over the
   player's own `KnowledgeFact` set (`KnowledgeService.knownTo(player)`, 0002) — content that already
   crossed via a modeled pathway and is already Journal-visible. **No undisclosed Vault content is read**
   to make a trade available; the engine consumes what is *already the player's knowledge*. The
   `tradedSecret`/`tradeSecret` calls validate the `factId` against the player's knowledge and **reject**
   anything else — the player cannot trade what they were never told (no minting ground truth, sibling to
   `surfaceInformationTo`'s lineage check, and to 0093's `factId` guard). **(R4 — the ownership check is
   the bright line.)**
2. **Surfacing a traded secret to the recipient (and any NPC↔NPC barter) is a modeled pathway, never a
   Vault read (R3).** When the player trades a secret to a recipient, the recipient learns it through
   `surfaceInformationTo` (a recorded *told* event with lineage), exactly as a confidence or gossip
   crosses — the engine never hands any surface the Vault; it records a new knowledge event whose origin
   is the player's trade. The NPC↔NPC barter writes the transfer in the **Vault** and reaches the player
   **only** when a pathway later terminates at them (0002/0094) — never as a Vault read.
3. **No number ever crosses, to player OR admin.** `tradeValue`, the deal-likelihood factor, the trade
   magnitudes, the NPC-barter folds, and every relationship/jury delta are Vault-hidden. Player surfaces
   show the *fact* of the trade and **observable** fallout (behavior) — never a value, never a fold size.
   **God Mode / admin is walled identically** (mandate #2): no admin projection exposes the trade value,
   the hidden barter, or the standing deltas; the load-bearing test sweeps the assembled admin/player
   surfaces for any sealed magnitude *and* for any NPC↔NPC traded fact the player has no pathway to.

## Determinism / calibration-neutrality

- **Seeded + deterministic.** Same seed + same history + same trade call ⇒ same `tradeValue`, same outcome,
  same folds; the NPC barter uses the dedicated side-rng so the order/choice of barters is reproducible.
  `secretTrade.ts` is pure (handed the already-read signals; rng injected).
- **Calibration byte-identical when unused.** With no `tradedSecret`/`tradeSecret` and the NPC-barter flag
  off, the 0039/0026/0094 folds and the seeded vote/eviction distributions are **byte-identical** — the
  feature adds no rng draw on the untouched path. The `juryReach` / UAT gates stay green unperturbed (the
  same discipline 0093/0086/0085 hold behind their flag). *(Build decision: whether the player-side trade
  and the NPC barter sit behind a flag — `ORWELL_SECRET_TRADE`, or fold into `ORWELL_CAMPAIGNS` for the
  off-screen half — is a build detail shared with 0093; the byte-identity guard is the requirement either
  way.)*

## Persistence (0007/0030 — non-degradation)

- A learned secret the player has **traded** carries (via 0093's sealed, monotonic `usedAs` marker,
  extended with a `traded` value) so the knowledge layer remembers exactly which secrets the player has
  spent and how. A secret can be traded to multiple recipients (sharing it widens who knows) — the
  *recipients* are recorded as ordinary 0002 knowledge events; what persists is that the player *used* it.
- The per-season **trade count** persists in the snapshot (sibling to 0093's expose count / 0075's lie
  count / `surfacedThreadCount`).
- The NPC↔NPC barter's resulting knowledge transfers + bond folds persist as ordinary Vault state /
  recorded events — already durable; the knowledge layer **deepens, never thins**.

## ADR 0003 fit — the conversation is still the game

This *augments* conversation, it does not move play into UI (ADR 0003 principle #4). The player **learns**
the secret in conversation (0075), **decides** to trade it in conversation (the model calls the lever from
the player's negotiation), and the **fallout is narrated** from engine truth. The lever is a *fact handed
to the model to voice* ("you have something they'd want; offer it for the vote"), never a script or a
dashboard "sell" button that replaces the scene. The NPC↔NPC barter is exactly the off-screen scheming the
#1 mandate demands. It earns its tokens against the four fixes: it strengthens **behavioral fidelity** (the
missing information-as-diplomacy beat + richer off-screen society) without touching leaks/sycophancy/memory
(all preserved by the structure above).

## Acceptance criteria (role-only; HARD rules — to firm up at build)

- [ ] **A held secret is tradeable to a third party.** A `KnowledgeFact` the player holds can be offered
      to a **recipient** (not necessarily the secret's subject) as consideration in a `makeDeal` and/or a
      `tradeSecret` swap; a secret the player has *not* learned (no pathway) offers **no** trade (the call
      is rejected).
- [ ] **The trade is valued *to the recipient*, and colors — never forces — the concession.** Offering a
      secret a recipient *wants* raises (bounded, seeded) the likelihood they accept/honor; a secret they
      don't care about, or distrust the source of, may be refused (and a bad trade may cost the trader
      standing). With no traded secret, deal formation is byte-identical to 0039/0093.
- [ ] **NPCs barter secrets with each other, hidden.** Off-screen, NPCs trade held secrets to buy
      bonds/votes; the trade, its price, and the magnitudes are **Vault-only**, surfacing to the player
      only via an existing pathway (0002/0094) — never as a Vault read. (Behind the off-screen flag.)
- [ ] **Vault Wall (player AND admin).** No undisclosed secret is read to make a trade available; the
      player can only trade their own learned facts; surfacing to the recipient/house is a modeled pathway
      (R3), never a Vault read; **no number** crosses to player or admin, and no NPC↔NPC traded fact
      reaches the player without a pathway (load-bearing sentinel sweep over both surfaces).
- [ ] **Anti-sycophancy (ADR 0005).** The engine owns the bounded, seeded magnitude; the model proposes
      only *which secret / to whom / the ask / the prose*. A trade can never be pumped to force an outcome.
- [ ] **Non-degradation.** `usedAs` (extended with `traded`) + the season trade count persist and survive
      a restart; trading a secret deepens the knowledge layer (recipients now know), never thins it.
- [ ] **Determinism + calibration-neutrality.** Seeded/deterministic; byte-identical `juryReach`/UAT on
      the untouched (no-trade, barter-off) path.

## PO review — owner rulings needed (before build)

This spec is deliberately a **proposal** and is the **sibling of 0093**. Four decisions shape the build and
want an owner ruling first. **Recommendation up front:** spec and build **0099 alongside 0093 as one build
spec** — "learn (0075) → leverage/expose (0093) → **trade** (0099)" is a single coherent
information-as-power mechanic over one set of modules (`leverage.ts`/`secretTrade.ts`,
`leverageConstants.ts`/`SECRET_TRADE`), one `usedAs` marker, one `factId` ownership check, and one
`makeDeal` host. Splitting them risks two parallel "use a secret" systems.

- **R1 — How much may a *trade* move the CLOSED set (the deal/vote/standing it buys)?** The engine keeps
  the bounded, seeded *magnitude* (anti-sycophancy — the model never bends an outcome; ADR 0005). The
  owner call is the **ceiling**: how strongly may a wanted secret push a recipient toward accepting/honoring
  a deal (a gentle nudge vs. a near-certain yes), and how much may an NPC↔NPC barter firm a hidden bond?
  *Recommendation:* keep it **firmly bounded and felt, never deterministic** — a traded secret is *pressure
  + incentive*, and the recipient can always refuse (worthless secret, distrusted source) — so it reads as
  diplomacy, not an "I win" button, and never flattens the seeded variance (the `juryReach` band stays the
  guard). Mirror 0093 R1 exactly so the two uses share one ceiling.

- **R2 — How does 0099 compose with 0093 (leverage/expose) AND 0039 (deals) so "learn → leverage → trade"
  is ONE coherent mechanic?** *Recommendation (strong): build 0099 **inside / alongside 0093's build spec.***
  0093's `leverage` (a secret used **over its subject** to color *that subject's* deal) and 0099's `trade`
  (a secret used **to a third-party recipient** to color *that recipient's* concession) are the **same
  shape** — an optional, Vault-free, `factId`-referencing descriptor on the **existing `makeDeal`** that
  the engine values (bounded, seeded) and folds into deal likelihood. They differ only in *whose* reads set
  the value (the subject's, for leverage; the recipient's, for a trade) and they share `expose` as the
  third use. Keep **one deal object, one ledger, one `usedAs` marker, one constants module, one ownership
  check** — leverage / trade / expose are three *uses* of a held `factId`, not three systems. A `tradeSecret`
  *swap* lever (secret-for-a-non-deal-concession) is the only piece that may warrant a distinct lever; the
  owner ruling is whether even that collapses into `makeDeal` (recommended) or stands alone.

- **R3 — Confirm surfacing stays a modeled pathway, never a Vault read.** When the player trades a secret to
  a recipient, the recipient must learn it through `surfaceInformationTo` (a recorded *told* event with
  lineage); the NPC↔NPC barter writes to the Vault and reaches the player only via an existing pathway
  (0002/0094) — the engine never hands any surface the Vault, and the player can only trade facts they
  already legitimately hold. *Recommendation: confirm* — this is the structural reason the Wall holds
  (sibling to 0075/0093); the build's load-bearing test pins it (including that no NPC↔NPC traded fact
  reaches the player without a pathway).

- **R4 — The player can only trade a `factId` they legitimately hold (confirm the bright line).** Every
  trade call (`tradedSecret` on `makeDeal`, or `tradeSecret`) must validate the offered `factId` against
  `KnowledgeService.knownTo(player)` and **reject** anything not in the player's own knowledge — no minting
  ground truth, no trading a secret you only *suspect* or never learned (sibling to `surfaceInformationTo`'s
  lineage check and 0093's R4 ownership guard). *Recommendation: confirm* — this is what keeps the trade an
  **information-economy move over already-Journal-visible knowledge**, not a Vault hole; the load-bearing
  test rejects an unheld/`suspicion`-only `factId`.

**If ruled as recommended, the build is (shared with 0093):** the trade `tradeValue`/`tradeOutcome` +
`npcBarterStep` folded into `src/engine/leverage.ts` (or a thin `secretTrade.ts`), the `SECRET_TRADE`
constants beside `LEVERAGE`, an optional `tradedSecret` descriptor on `makeDeal` (recipient-valued sibling
of 0093's `leverage`), the NPC↔NPC barter as a motive/price driver of the existing 0038/0094 diffusion,
the reused 0026/0014 folds, the extended `usedAs` (`traded`) + season-trade-count persistence, and the
gates below — a focused build spec shared with 0093 rather than a parallel system.

## Testability (role-only; HARD rules)

- **Vault Wall (the load-bearing test):** a secret the player has not learned offers no trade (the
  `tradedSecret`/`tradeSecret` call referencing it is rejected); a `suspicion`-only belief is not a
  tradeable `factId`; no trade value or hidden standing/barter delta appears on any player **or admin**
  projection; a sentinel sweep over the assembled player/admin surfaces finds no sealed magnitude **and**
  no NPC↔NPC traded fact the player has no pathway to.
- **Information becomes diplomacy:** a player holding a learned secret a recipient *wants* gains a concrete
  trade option that a player without it does not — asserted structurally on the available levers, not on
  prose.
- **Valued to the recipient, colors not forces:** a trade offering a secret the recipient *wants* raises
  the (bounded, seeded) deal accept/honor likelihood; the *same* secret offered to a recipient who doesn't
  care about its subject moves the likelihood ~nothing; a distrustful recipient can refuse (and a bad trade
  can cost the trader standing); with no trade, deal formation is byte-identical to 0039/0093.
- **NPC↔NPC barter is hidden + folds consequence:** off-screen, a holder trades a held fact to a recipient,
  firming a hidden bond and transferring the knowledge in the Vault; the player learns it only via a
  pathway (0002/0094); the barter is capped/rate-limited per the constants and seed-deterministic.
- **Anti-sycophancy:** no number crosses; the engine owns the magnitude; the model cannot pump a trade to
  force a deal (ADR 0005 — the `expressiveNonCollapse` sibling gate stays green on the untouched path).
- **Non-degradation:** `usedAs` (`traded`) + the trade count persist and survive a restart; recipients of
  a traded secret durably hold it (the knowledge layer deepens).
- **Determinism / calibration-neutral:** same seed + history ⇒ same trade value + outcome + barter
  sequence; byte-identical `juryReach`/UAT on the untouched (no-trade, barter-off) path.

## Dependencies & traceability

Builds on **0093** (secrets as levers — the lever family + `usedAs` this trade use extends), **0075** (the
learn-a-secret pathway), **0039** (deals — the trade host), **0002** (pathway propagation /
`surfaceInformationTo` + the `KnowledgeFact`/`factId` model + `knownTo` ownership check — how a trade
reaches the recipient/house), **0038/0094** (off-screen gossip diffusion + distortion — the substrate the
NPC↔NPC barter rides), **0017/0026** (relationship + betrayal-shock folds), **0023** (consequence fold),
**0014/jury** (jury demerits), persisted by **0007/0030**, under **0001** (Vault Wall) and **0021**
(isolation), on ADR **0005** (shape vs. magnitude) and ADR **0003** (the conversation is the game). Tracks
**#880**. Turns a learned secret from an asset spendable *on its subject* (0093) into a **liquid currency**
tradeable *to anyone who wants it* — an information economy of alliances and double-crosses, valued and
adjudicated by the deterministic core, never the narrator. Likely shares one build spec with 0093.
