Feature: Weekly loop orchestration — the playable week and season

  A week (one HOH reign) runs HOH competition -> nominations -> veto competition -> veto
  ceremony -> eviction vote -> live eviction, then repeats; the season runs down to Final 2
  and a jury vote decides the winner. The loop is pure, seed-deterministic state.

  Scenario: A seeded season runs from premiere to a single winner
    Given a new game of sixteen houseguests with a fixed seed
    When the season is played to completion
    Then it ends at a Final 2 followed by a jury vote
    And exactly one houseguest is declared the winner
    And replaying with the same seed yields the identical season

  Scenario: Each week follows the canonical phase order
    Given a week begins with an HOH competition
    Then it proceeds nominations, veto competition, veto ceremony, eviction vote, live eviction
    And a phase begins only after its predecessor has produced a result

  Scenario: The loop enforces the per-week legality rules
    Given an HOH, two nominees, and a veto holder for the week
    When the veto is used and the HOH names a replacement
    Then the replacement is not the veto winner
    And at eviction everyone except the HOH and the two nominees votes
    And the HOH votes only to break a tie

  Scenario: The jury is the last nine evictees
    When the season reaches Final 2
    Then the jury is composed of the last nine evicted houseguests
    And the earlier evictees are pre-jury

  Scenario: The endgame produces a winner by jury vote, with a last-juror tie-break
    Given a Final 2 and a jury
    When the jury votes
    Then the finalist with the most votes wins
    And a tied jury vote is broken by the last-evicted juror

  Scenario: NPC decisions are relationship-driven, not random
    Given an NPC holds power at a decision point
    When it nominates or votes across many seeded runs
    Then its target reflects its relationship reads (threat / trust), not chance

  Scenario: A player decision point is surfaced and validated
    Given the player holds power at a decision point
    Then the loop surfaces the pending decision and its legal options
    And it rejects any choice that violates an eligibility rule
