Feature: 0095 — Pre-show ties as time-bombs (a sealed pre-alliance detonates when exposed)
  A hidden pre-show tie (seeded by 0059 — two houseguests who knew each other before the show)
  stays Vault-sealed off the player AND the admin until a legitimate in-game pathway surfaces it
  (an overhear, a slip, an accusation that lands). When it is EXPOSED, the engine folds a bounded,
  seeded, house-shaking fallout: a betrayal-grade blow on the deceived edges and the house reading
  the pair as a hidden duo to target. The engine decides whether, which, to whom, and how big; the
  model only voices an exposure the engine has already committed. The tie reaches the player only
  through a pathway that terminates at them, recorded as the player's own knowledge.

  # Role-only (testing rule): the-player, a tied pair, a deceived houseguest, an onlooker,
  # a near-stranger pair, the house.

  Background:
    Given a started season with the player in the house
    And the hidden seeded relationship layer holds a pre-show tie between two houseguests

  Rule: A sealed tie never leaks before a pathway surfaces it — to player OR admin

    Scenario: The sealed tie is invisible on every surface
      Given the tie has not been exposed by any pathway
      Then the tie never appears on any player-facing surface
      And the tie never appears on any admin or God-Mode surface
      And the only trace of the tie is the houseguests' behavior, never a stated fact or a number

    Scenario: No pathway, no surfacing
      Given the tied pair is not conspicuous together
      And neither of the pair is under enough strain to let it slip
      And no one has accused the pair of a prior connection
      Then the tie stays sealed
      And no exposure is recorded
      And the house reads the pair as it would any other two houseguests

  Rule: A pathway exposes the tie and the house reacts

    Scenario: An overheard pairing surfaces the tie to the house
      Given the tied pair is conspicuously holed up together in a private room
      And a plausibly-positioned third houseguest is around to notice
      When the off-screen society tick fires the overhear pathway
      Then the tie is surfaced to the house through that onlooker
      And the houseguests who learn of it read the pair as a hidden duo to target
      And their trust in both members of the pair falls and their threat read of both rises
      And the fallout is bounded and never a flat house-wide flag

    Scenario: An accusation that lands exposes the tie and folds the fallout
      Given the player suspects the pair knew each other before the show
      When the player accuses the pair of a prior connection through the engine authority
      Then the engine confirms a real tie exists and the accusation lands
      And the exposure is recorded as the player's own knowledge through the pathway with content lineage
      And the secret pre-alliance coming out deals the deceived houseguests a betrayal-grade blow toward both members
      And the player is shown no number and no tell

    Scenario: An accusation against an untied pair misses
      Given a pair of near-strangers with no seeded tie
      When the player accuses that pair of a prior connection through the engine authority
      Then the accusation misses
      And no tie is surfaced and no sealed state is read
      And the attempt is recorded only as an ordinary social scene
      And the player is shown no number and no tell distinguishing a miss from a hit

  Rule: The engine decides and records; the model only voices

    Scenario: The model is never handed an unexposed tie
      Given the tie has not been exposed
      When the model fetches the houseguests' voices for a scene
      Then the voices carry no sealed tie content
      And only an exposure the engine has already committed is ever voiced as a public fact

    Scenario: The exposure reaches the player only through a pathway
      Given the tie has surfaced among the houseguests off-screen
      And no diffusion chain has yet reached the player
      Then the player holds no belief about the tie
      When a retelling chain finally terminates at the player
      Then the player learns of the tie as a belief with a source and a confidence
      And that belief is the player's recorded knowledge, never Vault content

  Rule: Exposures are rare, persisted, and calibration-neutral

    Scenario: The exposure state persists and is monotonic across a restart
      Given the tie has been exposed and is now public
      When the game is saved and restored
      Then the restored game still records the tie as exposed
      And the exposure never regresses to a less-exposed state

    Scenario: Lies-free exposures are capped across a season
      Given a full season is played
      Then the number of exposed pre-show ties never exceeds the season cap

    Scenario: With the feature off, the seeded outcomes are byte-identical
      Given the same seed is played with the tie-reveal feature off and on without a precipitant
      Then no exposure roll is taken and no relationship edge is touched
      And the seeded competition, jury, and eviction outcomes are byte-identical
