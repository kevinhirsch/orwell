Feature: Soul storage & memory recall — the house remembers the RIGHT moment

  The dynamic Soul is a growing markdown narrative plus an engine-only vector index. Semantic recall
  surfaces the most relevant past moments — feeding both how a houseguest behaves and what they can
  vividly remember — while the static Character stays byte-stable and the player sees no hidden soul.

  Background:
    Given a running game sandbox with a fully populated Producer's Vault

  Scenario: Recall returns the relevant memory, not just the recent one
    Given a houseguest whose soul holds one old salient memory and many recent trivial ones
    When memory is recalled for a context matching the old salient one
    Then the old salient memory is recalled
    And it is not crowded out by the recent trivial memories

  Scenario: Recall sharpens the relationship read (mechanics)
    Given a houseguest with a relevant adverse memory of the player
    When that memory is recalled into the relationship read
    Then the read reflects the adverse history even after a quiet recent stretch

  Scenario: Recall gives the narrator a specific memory (narration)
    Given a houseguest about to speak to the player about a past event they both witnessed
    When the narrator's context is assembled
    Then it includes the recalled specific memory
    And the houseguest can reference that specific past beat

  Scenario: A recalled HIDDEN memory shapes behavior but does not leak
    Given a houseguest recalls a memory the player did not witness and was never told
    When any player-facing surface is produced
    Then the hidden memory does not appear
    And no Vault sentinel value appears
    But the houseguest's behavior may still reflect it

  Scenario: The soul deepens over a game; the character does not
    Given a houseguest at premiere
    When many events accumulate over the season
    Then the soul's narrative and indexed-memory count grow
    And the growth is monotonic — no memory is thinned away
    And the static Character baseline is unchanged

  Scenario: The vector index is engine-only
    When the dependency graph is checked
    Then no outward module depends on the vector index or the full soul

  Scenario: Recall is deterministic under a seed
    Given a fixed seed and the deterministic test embedding
    When memory is recalled twice for the same context
    Then both recalls return the same memories
