Feature: Character evolution & season arc

  A season changes a houseguest. Consequential events move their hidden emotional state, that state bends
  their later competitions and decisions, and the trajectory accumulates into a recall-able arc — yet their
  static character baseline never changes, and the player sees the change only as behavior, never a number.

  Scenario: A blindside shifts the houseguest's emotional state
    Given a houseguest with a settled emotional state
    When they live through a blindside on the live path
    Then their hidden emotional state shifts toward distress and volatility

  Scenario: The shift modulates later behavior
    Given the same houseguest rattled versus calm
    When each plays a competition and faces a decision
    Then the rattled version behaves measurably differently from the calm version
    But emotion never overrides a hard rule

  Scenario: The change accumulates into a recall-able arc
    Given a houseguest who has been through several season-shaping events
    Then their soul accumulates those moments without losing earlier ones
    And a recall surfaces a specific past inflection that colors their later play

  Scenario: The static character stays byte-stable while the soul drifts
    Given a houseguest at the start and deep into the season
    Then their static character baseline is unchanged
    And only their dynamic soul has drifted

  Scenario: Emotional drift is bounded, mean-reverting, and deterministic
    Given a houseguest whose emotional state spiked
    When the game calms for a stretch
    Then their emotional state reverts toward their baseline within bounds
    And the same seed reproduces the same arc

  Scenario: The evolution is Vault-free
    Given a started game whose houseguests have evolved
    When the player's surfaces are read after the houseguests evolve
    Then no emotional number or hidden state appears
