## 1. Summary

The model can *produce* images as part of play — a houseguest's sketch, the memory-wall
portrait, a "camera still" of a scene — rendered **inline in the chat**. This completes the
analysis loop ruling #9 opened: E94 made attaching an image a first-class in-character input
("the player is showing something to whoever is present"); 0051 is the output direction.

The first deliverable fires **automatically at move-in**: as part of the `createCharacter` /
season-start beat, the engine generates a **photorealistic cast portrait set** (reality-TV-style
headshots) for each houseguest — no player prompt needed. The portraits appear inline in the
chat as the cast is introduced, then are **persisted to the engine data dir** (`ORWELL_DATA_DIR`)
so they are never lost and never re-generated on restart.

Persisted portraits feed a **cast roster sidebar** — a dedicated "who is who" reference the
player can open at any time. Each card shows the houseguest's portrait, name, and current game
status (active / jury / evicted). This replaces the prior external-document workaround and
gives the player a durable face-to-name reference throughout the season.

**Planned future extension (not in this spec's DoD):** small portrait thumbnails in the chat
window when the model is voicing a specific houseguest — the face appears naturally beside the
message. Specced here so the storage + port design plans for it; built separately.

## 2. Why this is a design pass, not a feature toggle

The audit names the questions this spec must answer (and the .feature pins):

1. **Which moments may generate** — player-requested ("draw me the memory wall") vs.
   producer-beat (auto-fires at move-in for portraits; engine-offered at key beats such as an
   eviction "camera still"). Both exist; neither is unbounded.
2. **How generation stays Vault-free** — image prompts are built **only from the player's
   visible state** (the same projection the chat narrator gets). The E11/E15 discipline
   applies to image prompts too: no hidden stat, edge, soul, confessional, or off-screen
   scene content may reach the image model, structurally — the prompt builder lives on the
   outward side of the wall and is sentinel-swept like every player surface.
3. **Seed/style consistency per season** — the house must look like itself: a per-season
   photorealistic style anchor (seeded at `createCharacter`, persisted in the snapshot) plus
   each houseguest's stable public appearance facets (0004 §8) feed every prompt, so the same
   houseguest renders recognizably as a photorealistic individual across the season and
   across restarts.
4. **Cost/latency gating** — generation is the most expensive lever in the game; budgets
   (per-turn / per-week caps, declared in a constants module, never inline) bound it, and
   an over-budget request is declined **in the production/show frame** ("production is hoarding
   the cameras tonight"). Move-in portrait generation is exempt from the per-turn cap (it is
   a bounded, one-time season-start cost).
5. **Graceful absence** — when no image-capable model is configured, the game plays
   identically: in-fiction refusal in the production frame ("the feeds can't render that"),
   no error surface, no broken affordance. Mirror of E94(c). The cast roster falls back to
   name + status cards with no portrait image.

## 3. Decisions (locked 2026-06-11)

| Decision | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Portrait trigger** | Auto on move-in — fires as part of `createCharacter` / season-start beat, no player prompt | The cast is introduced; their faces appear with them |
| **Visual style** | Photorealistic — reality-TV-style headshots and scene stills | The per-season style anchor is a photorealistic descriptor seeded at cast time |
| **Image provider** | Provider-agnostic `ImageGenerationPort` | First concrete adapter (DALL-E, Stability AI, etc.) wired at build time |
| **Settings location** | Existing image gen card in the Settings modal (AI section) — currently hidden; unhide and update model filter to text-to-image models | `image_gen_enabled`, `image_model`, `image_quality` already exist in `settings.py` and `settings.js`; the card just needs to be made visible and the model filter corrected |
| **Decline framing** | Production / show metaphor for all decline paths | "feeds are down," "production is holding the cameras," "that footage hasn't aired yet" — never a technical message, never a hint about hidden state |
| **Image persistence** | Engine data dir — `{ORWELL_DATA_DIR}/{user}/portraits/{houseguest-id}.*` | Co-located with the save; managed by the FE; `orwell-factory-reset.sh` must scrub the portraits dir |
| **Cast roster** | Sidebar panel — portrait + name + status (active / jury / evicted) | Status from the Vault-free public projection; evicted houseguests remain visible (dimmed/marked) for jury management reference |
| **Chat avatars** | Planned future extension — out of this spec's DoD | The storage and port design must not preclude it; built as a follow-on |

## 4. The rules that bind (non-negotiable)

- **Vault Wall:** the image-prompt builder takes the visible projection only; a structural
  test proves no Vault/engine-only handle is reachable from it, and a sentinel sweep proves
  no hidden content appears in any assembled image prompt.
- **Knowledge scope:** an image may depict only what the **player knows** — witnessed events,
  surfaced facts, public personas. A request to depict an off-screen scene the player never
  witnessed is refused in the production frame (suspicion is not footage). No pathway, no picture.
- **Anti-sycophancy / unresolved outcomes (the P1/P6 discipline):** no image may assert an
  outcome the engine has not resolved and revealed — no "camera still" of an eviction before
  the vote is revealed. Image generation narrates the record; it never front-runs it.
- **Recorded or it didn't happen:** a generated image shown in character is a beat — it is
  recorded (player-witnessed event referencing the image and its subject) like any scene.
  The E22 guard applies to image turns.
- **ADR 0003 — augment, never replace:** images render inline in the chat; the cast roster
  is a companion reference panel (sidebar), not a game-primary surface; no interaction that
  builds or progresses the game may *require* the image path; reduced/absent image capability
  never blocks play (cast roster falls back gracefully).
- **No number crosses:** portrait/scene prompts use qualitative public facets (appearance,
  presentation, archetype-flavored wording) — never stats, edges, or tier internals. The cast
  roster status field comes from the public game projection, never the Vault.
- **Decline framing is always the production frame:** whether the decline is budget, knowledge
  scope, or unresolved outcome, the in-fiction explanation is drawn from the BB production
  aesthetic — never a technical message, never a hint about what the hidden state contains.
- **Portraits are generated once per season start:** on restart, the stored portrait is served;
  re-generation is not triggered. If the portrait file is missing (first run or after a reset),
  it is regenerated on demand, not on every restart.
- **Factory reset must scrub portraits:** `orwell-factory-reset.sh` must delete the portraits
  dir alongside `.orwell-data` — a reset is a full reset.

## 5. Scope

**In:**
- The per-season photorealistic style anchor (seeded at `createCharacter`, persisted in the snapshot)
- The `ImageGenerationPort` (provider-agnostic; adapter wired at build time)
- The Vault-free image-prompt builder over visible state + public appearance facets
- Auto-firing cast portrait set at move-in (first deliverable, no player prompt)
- Player-requested images and engine-offered producer-beats (beyond portraits)
- Budget gating (constants module; move-in portraits exempt from per-turn cap)
- Inline chat rendering of generated images
- Portrait persistence: `{ORWELL_DATA_DIR}/{user}/portraits/`; survive restart; no re-generation if stored
- Cast roster sidebar: portrait + name + current status (active / jury / evicted); Vault-free; graceful fallback when no images
- Production-frame decline and absence paths
- Recording of image beats as player-witnessed events
- Factory reset integration (scrub portraits dir)

**Out:**
- Image *analysis* (that is E94, shipped/landing separately — this spec only pairs with it)
- General image gallery or editing of past stills (E93's no-rewriting rule covers depicted history too)
- NPC-to-NPC "images" (off-screen life stays textual in the hidden layer)
- Chat avatar thumbnails (planned future extension — storage + port must not preclude it)

## 6. Test strategy (at build time)

- **Engine/TS:** prompt-builder structural isolation (dependency-cruiser scope extension);
  sentinel sweep over assembled prompts; style-anchor persistence + same-seed reproducibility;
  budget constants honored; production-frame refusal on unwitnessed-scene and unresolved-outcome
  requests; image beats recorded; `ImageGenerationPort` wired behind the outward root.
- **FE/pytest + smoke:** auto-portrait generation at move-in (once per season start, not on
  restart); portrait persistence to data dir; cast roster renders with portrait + name + status;
  roster status reflects live game state (active / jury / evicted); roster graceful fallback when
  no image-capable model; no re-generation on restart when portrait already stored; factory reset
  scrubs portraits dir; no new chrome surface beyond the roster sidebar.

## 7. Definition of Done

All .feature scenarios green under their decided gates; the Vault-free prompt path proven
structurally; portraits generated once at move-in, persisted, and served from storage on
subsequent loads; cast roster accessible from a sidebar with portrait + name + status; play
unaffected when generation is unavailable; factory reset scrubs portraits; the README index
row flipped to Done.
