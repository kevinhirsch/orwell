# 0059 — Hidden seeded relationships (pre-game ties & showmances)

> **Status:** 📝 SPEC (design note — not yet built). Consolidates ledger items **L35** (pre-game
> relationships, approved 2026-06-19, twist-gated) and **L40** (showmance OVERLOAD — there is no
> showmance model, so the narrator reads *every* high-affinity bond as romance). Both are the same
> shape: a SMALL number of **hidden, seeded, Vault-sealed** relationship arcs that surface only
> through organic gameplay. **Depth reference (FORMAT/DEPTH only):** `docs/legacy/BB_ProducersVault.md`
> §4 (pre-game relationships) + §6 (the showmance profile). **Executable spec:**
> `0059-hidden-seeded-relationships.feature` *(authored at implementation, BDD-first)*.

## 1. Summary

A real *Big Brother* season carries a few relationships the cameras don't explain on day one: two
houseguests who **knew each other before the show** (and may hide it), and one or two genuine
**showmances** that develop over weeks. Today the engine models neither — so (a) there are no
pre-game ties at all, and (b) with no showmance concept, the narrator interprets the relationship
graph's many high-affinity edges as romances and produces **soap-opera saturation** ("everyone
romanced everyone," the 2026-06-19 finale Vault reveal). 0059 adds both as a **small, hidden,
seeded** layer that surfaces only organically — texture and drama without saturation, and never a
spoiler.

## 2. The two kinds (one model)

- **Pre-game ties (§4, L35):** a hidden pre-existing connection between two NPCs — met at a casting
  callback and silently agreed not to acknowledge it; a mutual friend; a shared hometown they don't
  mention. A *subtle behavioral seed* (unconscious warmth/protectiveness, a "destiny" bond on
  meeting), **never** a deterministic advantage.
- **Showmances (§6, L40):** a genuine romantic arc that develops *over weeks* between two
  houseguests (and possibly involving the player, if the player cultivates it). It begins as
  proximity/recognition, deepens to trust, and only later becomes visible to the house. **Never
  telegraphed; never week-one instant.**

Both are **directed/asymmetric beliefs in the same relationship layer** (0017/0026), tagged in the
Vault with a *kind* (`pre-game-tie` / `showmance`) and a *stage*, seeded sparsely at cast time.

## 3. Governed by the reserve-twist rules (0025) — the hard gate (L35 ruling)

This layer inherits the **reserve-twist governance** verbatim (feature 0025):

1. **Vault-sealed from the player AND the admin.** The engine generates + seals each tie; neither the
   player nor God Mode learns it in advance (mandate #2; `AdminPort` stays Vault-free).
2. **Held in reserve / SPARSE.** A small engine-decided count per season — **0–2 pre-game ties**,
   **0–2 showmances** (admin may set the budget like the twist count, 0016 — never the content).
   *Not every season has them*, and never "all bonds are romances." This sparseness is the direct
   fix for L40's saturation.
3. **Non-structural / format-preserving / never game-breaking.** A tie is a behavioral seed, never a
   deterministic edge that overrides legitimate play or a hard rule (0005).
4. **Engine-timed, seeded, organic surfacing — reveal-as-event only.** The tie exists at cast time
   but is **discovered only through in-game pathways** (a careful observer notices the warmth; an NPC
   slips; the showmance becomes visible once it has earned it) — **never** by exposition, never a
   "they have a secret" banner. Knowledge vs. suspicion holds (0002): the player may *suspect*
   without *knowing* until a pathway terminates at them.

## 4. The showmance model (fixing L40 directly)

- A showmance is a **seeded, staged** romantic arc — `{ a, b, stage, started }` in the Vault, where
  `stage` advances (`spark → bond → visible → resolved`) only as the live relationship between the
  two genuinely develops (high mutual affinity sustained over weeks), **never** instantly.
- **The narrator voices romance ONLY for a sealed, surfaced showmance** — a plain high-affinity
  friendship is a friendship, not a showmance. This is the prompt-side half: the moment prompt stops
  the GM from labeling every close bond a "showmance," and lets it voice romance only when the
  engine has surfaced one. (Interim, before the model ships: the pin alone curbs the saturation.)
- **Player showmances** develop *iff the player cultivates them* (v0 §6 discipline): organic,
  earned, never pushed — pure anti-sycophancy. The player's romantic interest is the human's to
  form; the engine never asserts it.

## 5. Surfacing & the consequence loop (reuse, don't rebuild)

Seeded ties reuse the existing organs (as 0058's threads do): the relationship layer (0017/0026)
carries the edges; **pathway propagation (0002)** governs discovery (witnessed/told/overheard/gossip
drift, with provenance + confidence); the **off-screen society (0038)** lets ties move when the
player is away; the **consequence fold (0023)** lets a discovered tie shift third-party reads. The
Vault hidden-records seam (0001/0025) seals + persists them (0030). A pre-game tie's "unconscious
protectiveness" is folded as a small standing affinity bias between the two — visible to a careful
player only as *behavior*.

## 6. Vault-Wall guarantees & testability

- **No tie, stage, or partner ever reaches the player OR the admin** until a modeled pathway
  surfaces it — sentinel-tested on the player surface, the admin/God-Mode surface, `npcVoice`, and
  the moment prompt (extends the 0001 canary). Dependency-cruiser stays green (no `VaultStore` edge).
- **Sparseness asserted:** across seeds, the seeded count stays within budget (≤2 each) — a property
  test that the cast is never saturated with romances (the L40 regression guard).
- **Organic-only surfacing:** a sealed tie reaches the player's knowledge ONLY after a pathway
  terminates at them; absent a pathway it stays Vault-only (player may suspect).
- **Non-degradation:** ties persist across restart (0030); the showmance stage only advances, never
  silently resets.
- **Player showmance is earned:** a property/scenario test that a passive player accrues no romance
  the engine wasn't cultivated into (anti-sycophancy).
- **No structural break:** the 0005 hard rules + the core arc hold under any seeded tie (like 0025).

## 7. Out of scope / relationships

- **Reuses:** 0025 (reserve seal + governance), 0017/0026 (the edges), 0002 (pathways), 0038
  (off-screen), 0023 (the fold), 0001 (the wall).
- **Pairs with:** 0058 (deep profiles — a pre-game tie is a special seeded thread class) and 0016
  (the admin budget knob, count-only).
- **Not here:** a dating-sim UI, any player-facing "relationship status," or a guaranteed showmance —
  all would break the wall or the earned-not-given discipline.
