Feature: Strategic-drive off-screen cadence

  In a real house, the schemers drive the game a little more than the passive players. When this layer is
  on, a houseguest's strategic intelligence and personality gently weight how often they start an off-screen
  scene — a slight variance, never a wild skew. When it is off, everyone starts scenes equally (the seeded
  society is byte-identical). It never crosses the Vault Wall.

  Scenario: A sharper, more-strategic houseguest carries a higher drive
    Given a started game with a scheming house
    When each houseguest's strategic drive is read
    Then a sharper, more-strategic houseguest weighs more than a passive one
    And the difference is slight, never a wild skew

  Scenario: With the cadence off, the off-screen society is byte-identical
    Given two games from the same seed with the strategic cadence off
    When the same off-screen ticks run on each
    Then their hidden societies are identical

  Scenario: Turning the cadence on shifts who schemes, still deterministically
    Given the same seed with the strategic cadence on versus off
    When the same off-screen ticks run on each
    Then the on cadence changes the off-screen initiator pattern
    And the on cadence is itself seed-deterministic

  Scenario: The cadence never crosses the Vault Wall
    Given a started game with the strategic cadence on
    When the cadenced off-screen society runs several ticks
    Then no off-screen scene is witnessed by the player
