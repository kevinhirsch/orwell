# 0001 — Vault Wall isolation

> **Status:** Built (see the [README status index](./README.md#index)).
> **Build priority:** #1 — the top of the order (`CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` §9) and the
> #2 non-negotiable in the mandate (`CLAUDE.md`).
> **Stack (resolved):** TypeScript / Node 22 · SQLite-now / Postgres-ready · vector store from
> day one · Cucumber.js + Vitest + fast-check + dependency-cruiser. Details in §8.
> **Executable spec:** [`0001-vault-wall-isolation.feature`](./0001-vault-wall-isolation.feature)

## 1. Summary

No Producer's Vault content — hidden attributes, NPC confessionals, hidden threads,
off-screen events the player did not witness, twists held in reserve — **nor any inference
uniquely derived from it** — may reach the player through **any** player-facing surface
(scene narration, NPC dialogue, system messages, logs, end-of-session summaries). The
**administrator (God Mode) is walled from the Vault as well**: admin inspects non-Vault
state only.

Enforcement is **structural, never prompt-based**: player-facing and admin-facing surfaces
are *incapable* of reading the Vault. The narrator **cannot leak what it never receives**.

## 2. Why this is first

It is the project's stated #1 implementation priority and its strongest correctness
guarantee. Building it first forces the foundational seams into existence — the engine-only
`VaultStore`, the single `EventStore` with per-event visibility, and the **visible
projection** that outward surfaces consume — which every later feature leans on. A leak here
is a **failure state**, not a partial success.

## 3. Scope

**In scope**
- The structural boundary that prevents any player- or admin-facing adapter/tool from
  reading `VaultStore`.
- The visible projection that outward surfaces consume instead.
- Content, summary, interrogation, competition-result, and capability guarantees in the
  `.feature` file.

**Out of scope (separate features, referenced only to fix the boundary)**
- **Event visibility & propagation (#2):** how hidden facts *become* known via in-game
  pathways. This feature assumes only a minimal `KnowledgeState` and per-event
  `witness set` + `hidden flag` exist; the propagation feature builds them out.
- **Diary Room sanctity / "public vs private speech":** the player's DR is *player*
  knowledge (not Vault), but must never inform NPC behavior. That is a **different wall**
  (DR → NPC) from the Vault Wall (Vault → player/admin). Only the *NPC-confessional* half
  (which **is** Vault content) is exercised here.
- Authoring/migrating real Vault contents (a dev-time concern; the running game surfaces
  Vault contents to no one).

## 4. Surfaces & contracts (stack-agnostic)

Language-neutral sketch — names match `CLAUDE.md`. The implementer maps these onto the
chosen stack.

```
# Engine-only (NEVER injected into any outward-facing adapter/tool)
VaultStore:
    readHidden(query)  -> HiddenRecord        # confessionals, hidden attrs, off-screen events, reserved twists

# The single interaction record; visibility is per-event metadata
EventStore:
    record(event{ initiator, witnessSet, hidden, content })
    query(filter)      -> [Event]

# What outward surfaces are allowed to consume
VisibleStateService:                           # the ONLY state source for outward channels
    getVisibleStateFor(entity) -> VisibleState # events where entity ∈ witnessSet, + entity's KnowledgeState; excludes hidden/unknown
KnowledgeService:
    knownTo(player)    -> KnowledgeState        # facts surfaced via legitimate pathway

# Outward channels — depend on VisibleStateService, never on VaultStore
PlayerSurface (drives NarrativePort):
    render(scene | dialogue | log | summary)   <- VisibleState only
AdminPort (God Mode):
    inspect(query)     -> NonVaultState         # no method returns Vault data
SummaryService:
    endOfSession()     -> "Updated save(s) available."   # nothing more
```

**The crux (the structural guarantee):** `VaultStore` is wired (DI/imports) only into
engine/simulation components. The player renderer, the admin port, and every MCP tool
exposed to the player or admin channel resolve their data **exclusively** through
`VisibleStateService` / `KnowledgeService`. There is **no dependency edge** from any
outward-facing module to `VaultStore`. Because the context handed to the narrative layer is
assembled solely from the visible projection, there is no Vault-derived material in scope
for the model to infer from — which is how the *"no uniquely-derivable inference"* clause is
satisfied by construction rather than by judgment.

## 5. Test strategy (how to operationalize, incl. the "inference" clause)

Four complementary checks; together they make the `.feature` enforceable:

1. **Sentinel / canary content test.** A fixture populates the Vault so every hidden datum
   embeds a unique sentinel marker not derivable from visible state. Across many seeded runs
   and every outward surface type, assert **no sentinel appears**. This operationalizes both
   "no Vault content" and "no uniquely-derivable inference" — the sentinel is the only place
   that information exists, so if it never appears, nothing was derived from it.
2. **Context-assembly test.** Assert the context object handed to the narrative layer
   contains **zero** sentinels. (Defends the inference clause at the source.)
3. **Architecture / dependency test.** Assert the dependency graph has **no path** from any
   player- or admin-facing module to `VaultStore` (e.g. an import-boundary / layering test
   in the chosen stack). This is the structural proof, independent of any single run.
4. **Capability test.** Enumerate the tools available in the player channel and in the
   admin/God-Mode channel; assert the set is a fixed allowlist that contains **no** Vault
   reader, and that attempting to obtain one fails.

Use **seeded** randomness so runs are reproducible, and make checks **property-style** (many
seeds × many surfaces × many Vault shapes), per `CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` §9.4.

## 6. Acceptance criteria / Definition of Done

Mirrors `CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` §11:

- [ ] Every scenario in `0001-vault-wall-isolation.feature` passes, name-agnostic.
- [ ] Vault isolation verified on **both** a player surface and the admin/God-Mode surface.
- [ ] The architecture/dependency test proves **no** outward module reads `VaultStore`.
- [ ] The narration context is proven Vault-free (sentinel test over many seeds & surfaces).
- [ ] End-of-session summary emits only "updated save(s) available."
- [ ] Domain logic exercised here is unit-tested with the **seeded** `RandomnessSource`.

## 7. Edge cases the spec deliberately pins

- **Summaries** may confirm only that updated saves exist — no change description, no Vault
  section names.
- **Direct interrogation** ("is X true / is X in the Vault?") must not confirm or deny
  specific Vault content.
- **Competition results** are delivered as outcomes — never stat scores, ratings, or
  rankings (legacy Vault-Wall rule).
- **NPC confessionals** are Vault content and never surface; the **player's DR** is not Vault
  content (handled by a separate wall — see §3).
- **Over-blocking guard:** a fact already surfaced via a legitimate pathway *may* appear,
  sourced from the player's `KnowledgeState`. The boundary is **provenance**, not content —
  otherwise the Wall becomes a blanket gag and the game can't deliver gossip.

## 8. Implementer handoff — resolved stack & decisions

The stack is **chosen** — this feature is no longer gated. Build against these:

- **Language / runtime:** **TypeScript / Node 22.** The domain core stays pure TS (no I/O).
- **Test runners:** **Cucumber.js** executes the `.feature` files (BDD); **Vitest** for unit
  tests; **fast-check** for the property / distribution checks; **dependency-cruiser** for the
  architecture test that proves no outward module imports `VaultStore`.
- **Datastore:** **SQLite now** (`better-sqlite3`) behind `GameStateRepository` / `EventStore`,
  **Postgres-ready** (swap the adapter later, no domain-core change). Tests use **in-memory**
  adapters.
- **Vectors (adopted now):** **sqlite-vec** for the vector index now → **pgvector** on Postgres
  later, behind a `VectorIndex` port reached **only** through `SoulProvider`. Embeddings sit
  behind an `EmbeddingProvider` port with a **deterministic fake** for offline / seeded tests
  and a real provider wired at runtime. The vector index holds Vault-side soul data, so it is
  **engine-only — no outward channel may depend on it**, exactly like `VaultStore`.
- **Sentinel mechanism (resolved):** enforcement is **structural** (composition roots +
  dependency-cruiser) plus **test-fixture canaries** (`§5`) — **no runtime provenance
  tagging**. The boundary is physical, so outward code cannot carry Vault data by construction;
  a runtime taint would only guard a path that, by that same construction, never holds any.
- **Boundary enforcement:** outward channels (player surface, admin / God-Mode port, and the
  player / admin MCP tools) are wired in **composition roots that never import `VaultStore`
  or the vector index**; run the player / admin MCP server with no Vault handle. Verified by
  **dependency-cruiser** (forbidden-edge rule) plus the capability test.
- **Tool registry:** player / admin MCP tools are a **fixed allowlist** containing no Vault
  reader; that registry is the single source of truth for the capability test.
- **Sequencing:** needs a minimal `EventStore` (witness set + hidden flag) and a stub
  `KnowledgeState`; implement just enough of both for these scenarios (#2 deepens them).
- **First step:** stand up the in-memory `EventStore` + `VaultStore`, then implement
  `VisibleStateService` and the player / admin surfaces so the `0001` scenarios go red → green.
