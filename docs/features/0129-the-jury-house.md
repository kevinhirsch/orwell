# 0129 — The jury house (living with the evicted: perspectives, Q&A, and an informed vote)

> **Status:** 📝 **Spec only** — authored during the 0046 PO review (2026-07-13), **not yet built** (PO: "write
> the spec for this and build later again"). **Expands 0046** (player eviction & the juror's seat) and pairs
> with its **ceremonies-as-broadcast** knowledge model. Today an evicted player on the jury watches a paced,
> Vault-safe **broadcast** of the remaining weeks — *alone*. This spec adds the **jury house**: the other
> evicted houseguests are there too, and the player can hear the season **from their perspective**, **ask them
> questions**, get their read on who's left, and walk into the finale vote **informed** — the _Big Brother_
> "jury roundtable" that is where the vote is really decided.

## 1. Summary

0046 made losing faithful: you take the juror's seat and watch the public ceremonies broadcast to the finale.
But it's a solo, passive fast-forward. In the show, the jury is a **place full of people** — every houseguest
you and the house evicted, living together, comparing notes, nursing grudges, and arguing about who deserves
to win. 0129 turns the spectate phase into that: the player, as a juror, can **talk to the other jurors**,
**hear the game from each of their (biased, partial) points of view**, **ask them what they know and think**,
and get a rolling **update on the house** as each new evictee arrives — all of it feeding the read the player
carries into their 0037 finale vote. Losing stays engaging, and the vote stops being a cold menu pick.

## 2. What exists today (the gap this closes)

- **0046: solo broadcast.** The juror learns only the **public ceremony outcomes** (Vault-safe, 0002) and
  fast-forwards to the finale. Correct and leak-proof, but **the other jurors are invisible** — the player
  never talks to them, never hears their side, never feels the jury as a room.
- **0037: the vote arrives cold.** The player's finale juror vote is a validated pick with no deliberation
  behind it — none of the "the jury talked it out and turned on the frontrunner" drama the show is famous for.
- **The evictees already carry rich state** (their soul, their relationship to the player, and the recorded
  eviction **manner** — bitter / blindsided / respected, 0037/0014) that nothing surfaces once they're out.

## 3. Scope

**In:** a **jury-house social surface** available while the player holds `player.status === "jury"` (0046):

- **The jurors are present.** A Vault-free `juryHouse` projection lists the evicted houseguests currently in
  the jury and, per juror, **what they can legitimately talk about** — their own witness-bounded knowledge
  (everything they saw before *their* eviction) + the shared **broadcast** since (0046) + what other jurors
  have told them. **Never** the live house's hidden scheming or confessionals (they're sequestered).
- **Perspective.** Each juror tells the season **their way** — colored by their soul, their read on why they
  went home, and the **manner** of their eviction (a juror the player blindsided is prickly; one the player
  treated well is candid). Two jurors can hold **contradictory** beliefs about the same event (0002/0038 —
  belief, not truth).
- **Q&A (bidirectional).** The player can **ask a juror questions** — "what do you think of the frontrunner?",
  "who do you think wins?", "what really happened with that vote?" — and the narrator answers **in that
  juror's voice, grounded in that juror's actual knowledge + opinion**. Jurors also **approach the player**
  (a new arrival with fresh news, a juror lobbying for their pick).
- **House updates.** As each new evictee joins the jury, the room's collective picture **updates** — the new
  arrival brings the freshest (still pre-*their*-eviction) read plus the broadcast everyone shares.
- **An informed vote.** The deliberation is what the player carries into the **0037** finale juror vote — the
  vote is now the payoff of the roundtable, not a cold pick.

**Out:** the finale vote *mechanic* itself (0037 — unchanged; this feeds the player's read, it doesn't change
the validated seam); the broadcast knowledge model (0046 — reused, not replaced); NPC-juror **vote formation**
(the show's roundtable also moves *other* jurors' votes — that is **calibration-sensitive** and is called out
as an **optional flagged sub-scope / deferred follow-on** in §4, not the core of this feature); changing how
NPCs are evicted (0045).

## 4. Design

- **A Vault-free `juryHouse` projection.** While `player.status === "jury"`, `GameStateView` exposes the jury
  roster and, per juror, a **shareable-knowledge view** = that juror's `KnowledgeState` (already witness-bounded
  by 0002) filtered to what they'd actually say, plus their **stance toward the player** (relationship + the
  recorded eviction manner) and their **reads** (predictions/opinions computed from their knowledge + soul).
  **Structurally leak-proof:** because the source is each juror's own witness-bounded knowledge, a Vault
  sentinel from scheming that happened **after** that juror left can never appear — the same 0002 guarantee
  0046 relies on (extend the 0001 canary to the jury-house projection).
- **Perspective = engine-grounded, narrator-voiced (anti-sycophancy).** A juror's slant is **computed** — a
  bitter juror is bitter because the recorded manner says so; their prediction favors whoever their soul
  respects. The narrator **voices** that; it never invents a juror's opinion out of nothing. Contradiction
  between jurors is real (each reads from their own belief, 0002/0038), not scripted drama.
- **Conversation reuses the live social seam.** The player↔juror Q&A runs through the **same social-approach
  machinery** as in-house play (0036/0049) — scoped to the jury house — and is **player-witnessed** (not
  hidden). The narrator answers each question from the addressed juror's shareable-knowledge view. Model
  under-call is caught by the existing `_auto_record_scene` belt family, same as live play.
- **Pacing.** 0129 replaces 0046's *silent* fast-forward with an **interactive** spectate: the broadcast
  ceremonies still arrive on a bounded pace, but between them the player can mill the jury house and talk —
  the player owns when to move on to the finale (the same "lingering is play" principle, ADR 0003 / 0049).
- **Calibration.** The **core** (perspectives, Q&A, updates, the player's informed vote) is a **Vault-free
  projection + player-facing narration** that touches **no seeded state** — so it is **calibration-neutral by
  construction** (byte-identical seeded spine, like the 0125 projection). The **optional sub-scope** — letting
  the jury-house deliberation **nudge other jurors' finale votes** (a real BB roundtable effect) — *does* move
  the seeded finale, so it ships **default-off** behind `ORWELL_JURY_ROUNDTABLE` with a `juryReach`/finale
  re-check, or is deferred entirely. The core needs no flag.
- **Vault Wall.** Everything a juror can share is broadcast + their own pre-eviction memory + jury gossip — no
  live scheme, no confessional, no number crosses (canary-tested). The player's own jury-house talk has **no
  pathway back into the still-playing house** (the jurors are sequestered; nothing they say to the player
  reaches an active houseguest) — the mirror of the Diary-Room one-way rule.

## 5. Contracts (stack-agnostic)

```text
while player.status == "jury" (0046):
  GameStateView += juryHouse: {
    jurors: [ per juror: {
      shareableKnowledge,          // = juror's own KnowledgeState (0002 witness-bounded) + broadcast + jury gossip
      stanceTowardPlayer,          // relationship + recorded eviction MANNER (bitter/blindsided/respected)
      reads,                       // predictions/opinions computed from knowledge + soul (belief, can be wrong/contradict)
    } ]
  }                                // Vault-free; NEVER live scheming/confessional (sequestered) [0002/0001]
player asks a juror a question → narrator answers in that juror's voice, grounded in shareableKnowledge (0036/0049 seam)
new evictee joins → jury-house picture updates (their fresh pre-eviction read + shared broadcast)
the deliberation informs the player's 0037 finale juror vote (mechanic UNCHANGED)
core = projection + narration ⇒ calibration-neutral (no seeded mutation);
optional ORWELL_JURY_ROUNDTABLE (default off) = NPC-juror vote nudging (calibration-sensitive; juryReach re-check) — deferred
```

## 6. Definition of Done (when built)

- [ ] **The jury is a room:** while a juror, the player sees the other jurors and can talk to any of them;
      jurors also approach the player.
- [ ] **Perspective is grounded + biased:** each juror tells the season from their own belief, colored by
      their soul + eviction manner; two jurors can contradict; the narrator voices it, the engine grounds it.
- [ ] **Q&A works:** the player asks a juror a question and gets an answer from **that juror's** knowledge +
      opinion (never another's, never the Vault).
- [ ] **Rolling updates:** each new evictee's arrival updates the jury-house picture.
- [ ] **Informed vote:** the deliberation feeds the player's 0037 finale vote (mechanic unchanged).
- [ ] **Vault-safe:** a planted sentinel from post-a-juror's-eviction scheming never reaches that juror or the
      player (extend the 0001 canary to the jury-house projection); jurors share only broadcast + own memory +
      jury gossip; no number crosses; the player's jury-house talk reaches no active houseguest.
- [ ] **Calibration-neutral core:** the seeded spine (juryReach/gradient/UAT/golden) is **byte-identical**
      (the core mutates no seeded state); any NPC-vote-nudging is behind default-off `ORWELL_JURY_ROUNDTABLE`.
- [ ] Seed-deterministic; name-agnostic (roles only — juror/evictee/finalist); restart mid-jury-house resumes
      (0030); `0129` added to `cucumber.cjs`; `npm test` green.

## 7. Dependencies & traceability

Expands **0046** (juror seat + the ceremonies-as-broadcast knowledge model — reused as the leak-proof spine)
and hands the enriched read to **0037** (the finale juror vote, unchanged). Reuses the **0002** witness model
(each juror's shareable knowledge is already witness-bounded), the **0036/0049** social-approach seam (the
Q&A), the recorded eviction **manner** (0037/0014), and **0038** belief/gossip (jurors hold biased,
contradictory reads). Under **0001** (Vault Wall) and **0030** (restart), framed by **0018/momentPrompts**.
The optional roundtable sub-scope touches the finale calibration (juryReach), hence its default-off flag.

## 8. Implementer-ready (Definition of Ready) — when scheduled

**Touch points (exact):**
- `src/ports/GameSession.ts` — add the Vault-free `juryHouse` shape to `GameStateView` (roster + per-juror
  `shareableKnowledge` / `stanceTowardPlayer` / `reads`); populated only while `player.status === "jury"`.
- `src/services/` (the `KnowledgeService`/`VisibleStateService` layer) — derive each juror's **shareable**
  view from their own witness-bounded `KnowledgeState` (0002) + the 0046 broadcast record + jury gossip;
  **never** the live hidden layer. Extend the 0001 Vault canary to this projection.
- `src/engine/momentPrompts.ts` — a `jury-house` `MOMENT_PROMPTS` fragment (the player mills the jury house,
  hears perspectives, asks questions) + a `momentForPhase` mapping; the narrator answers a question from the
  addressed juror's shareable view.
- `src/engine/liveSeason.ts` — while the player is a juror, run the **interactive** spectate (0046's bounded
  broadcast + jury-house social beats) instead of a silent fast-forward; a new evictee joining updates the
  roster; hand off to 0037 at the finale.
- FE: a jury-house social surface (reuse the live social-approach UI, scoped to jurors) + the Q&A path through
  the existing agent-tool social seam; the `_auto_record_scene` belt covers model under-call.
- **Optional (deferred, flagged):** `ORWELL_JURY_ROUNDTABLE` — jury-house deliberation nudges NPC jurors'
  finale votes; default-off, `juryReach`/finale re-check; byte-identical off.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/juryHouse.test.ts` (roster, per-juror shareable-knowledge bounding, the Vault canary,
  contradiction-between-jurors, restart-resume) + `docs/features/0129-*.feature` → `cucumber.cjs`.

**Open decision (deferred to build time):** whether to ship the optional NPC-juror-vote roundtable effect at
all, or keep 0129 purely the player's *experience* (perspectives + Q&A + informed own-vote). Spec ships the
experience as the core; the vote-nudging is flagged and optional.
