/**
 * dependency-cruiser configuration — the STRUCTURAL proof of the Vault Wall.
 *
 * The crux of feature 0001: no outward-facing module (player surface, admin /
 * God-Mode port, the visible-state services they consume, or the outward
 * composition root) may depend on the engine-only `VaultStore` / `VectorIndex`
 * ports, their adapters, or the engine composition root that wires them.
 *
 * `tsPreCompilationDeps: true` makes the check catch even type-only imports, so
 * an outward module cannot so much as *name* the Vault types.
